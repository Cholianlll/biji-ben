1. Rice Chapter 5, questions 20, 21 (a).

2. Outline and conduct a Monte Carlo approximation to the following integral:

  $$I = \int_0^{\infty} 25 x^2 cos(x^2) exp(-25 x) dx$$


3.  Let $U \sim \textrm{uniform}(0,1)$. 

    a. Show that both $-\log(U)$ and $-\log(1-U)$ are exponential random variables.
    b. Show that $\log\left( \frac{u}{1-u} \right)$ is a logistic(0,1) random variable.
    c. Show how to generate samples from a logistic($\mu$, $\beta$).
