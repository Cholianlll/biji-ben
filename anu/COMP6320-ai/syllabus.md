### Textbook

Course textbook is "*Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach*", by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (Prentice Hall 3rd Edition, or Pearson Edition). This book gives a comprehensive tour of AI, and only a subset of it is part of the course material. Details about which chapters are included and additional course material will be given by the lecturers for each topic.

### Assessment

Assessment consists of:

- four programming assignments worth a total of 38 marks
- a number of quizzes, administered during tutorials, worth a total of 12 marks
- a final exam worth 50 marks.

The deadline for assignments is midnight on Friday at the dates specified above. Any assignment submitted late, or any quiz not returned at the end of the tutorial class which the student is enrolled in will be given a mark of zero. **This means that if you do not attend your tutorial sessions, you will lose marks. Exemptions will require a medical certificate or similarly good reason.**

**Hurdle:** The minimum final mark required for a pass grade is 50% as usual. Note, however, that in order **to obtain a passing grade, students must score at least 40% (of the 50 marks) on the exam**.



### [Assignments](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/course/view.php?id=23587#section-5)

Assignments will be posted here.

We remind students that we support the ubuntu distribution of Linux. **We are not in the business of porting assignments to arbitrary operating systems** such as windows or OSX. Students can install a virtual machine (using environments such as virtualbox or vmware) and run their assignments there. Your assignments will be tested under ubuntu and will need to compile and run under this OS.

All submitted materials (code, papers, etc.) need to be clearly attributed, that is, the name and student number of the author need to be present in the file as a comment (if code) or in some other suitably visible fashion for other kind of materials. 

Submitted files need to be uploaded as **one single compressed file;**  Submit your file in **zip format.**

The file **must** be named according to the following scheme

uXXXXX.zip

where XXXXX is your ANU student ID. 

Failure to comply with these instructions **will result in the submission not being accepted**.

Files can get sometimes corrupted while uploading - make sure you can download and open normally your submission. In case of glitches or other mistakes - such as submitting an empty compressed file (really, this happened often last year), or a previous assignment, or some other random stuff in your hard disk - we'll be contacting you via the official ANU email to provide us with the correct version of the file within a strict deadline. **Not responding to these communications in a timely fashion will be interpreted as you foregoing the opportunity to submit.**

Most assignments require Python. Note that in Python indentation, white space and file encoding are part of the syntax. The interpreter will reject your code if:

- your indentation isn't consistent (e.g. you're mixing spaces and tabs, or in some lines at the same indentation level you use 4 space/tabs and in others 2)
- you have non utf-8 characters in the source and don't add a suitable encoding descriptor (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding))

**Such errors will be deemed as compilation errors, and we're not in the business of fixing your code, so those files will be counted as not submitted.**
