# This is an additional and simpler example on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to supplement the 
# one shown on pages 13 to 18 of the brick.

# The example uses a set of data reported in Daniel (1995) comparing the Birthweight (gms)
# and the Gestation periods (weeks) of mothers who do Smoke with mothers who do not. 
# Firstly, read in and attach the data:

SmokersBabies <- read.table("SmokersBabies.txt",header=T)
summary(SmokersBabies)
attach(SmokersBabies)

# Separate the data into smokers and non-smokers:

Smokers <- SmokersBabies[Smoker=="Y",]
NonSmokers <- SmokersBabies[Smoker=="N",]

# Fit separate models for smokers and non-smokers and examine the coefficients:

Smokers.lm <- lm(Birthweight ~ Gestation, data=Smokers)
coef(Smokers.lm)
NonSmokers.lm <- lm(Birthweight ~ Gestation, data=NonSmokers)
coef(NonSmokers.lm)

# Fit a model for the two groups combined:

All.lm <- lm(Birthweight ~ Gestation)
coef(All.lm)

# Create a blank plot:

plot(Gestation, Birthweight, type="n", xlab="Gestastion Period (weeks)", ylab="Birthweight (gms)")

# Add the observations and regression lines for the two groups:

points(Smokers$Gestation, Smokers$Birthweight, pch="Y")
abline(Smokers.lm)
points(NonSmokers$Gestation, NonSmokers$Birthweight, pch="N")
abline(NonSmokers.lm)

# Add the combined regression line:

abline(All.lm, lty=2)

# Fit an ANCOVA model which allows for two lines with differing intercepts and slopes,
# using dummy variable coding (treatment contrasts), which is actually the default in R:

SmokersBabies.ancova <- aov(Birthweight ~ Gestation + Smoker + Gestation:Smoker, contrasts=list(Smoker=contr.treatment))

# Note that the much shorter version below would also have fitted the same model:
# SmokersBabies.ancova <- aov(Birthweight ~ Gestation*Smoker)

# Compare coefficients with earlier models:

coef(SmokersBabies.ancova)
coef(NonSmokers.lm)
coef(Smokers.lm)

# Fit an ANCOVA model which allows for two lines with differing intercepts and slopes, 
# using effect variable coding (sum constrasts):

SmokersBabies.ancova2 <- aov(Birthweight ~ Gestation + Smoker + Gestation:Smoker, contrasts=list(Smoker=contr.sum))

# Again compare coefficients with earlier models:

coef(SmokersBabies.ancova2)
coef(NonSmokers.lm)
coef(Smokers.lm)

# Finally decide on a final model (using either of the above ANCOVA models):

summary(SmokersBabies.ancova)
summary(SmokersBabies.ancova2)

# The interaction term is not significant, so different slopes are not required, just different
# intercepts. Note that here I am assuming this is observational data, not some sort of 
# quasi-experimental design (even though there were equal numbers of smokers and non-smokers). 
# If it were an experimental design, the model with interaction (i.e. all possible combinations
# of the factors) would probably have been the reference model assumed as part of the design,
# rather than just the null (or intercept only) model we use with purely observational data. 
# As with terms that are a crucial to the research question with observational models,we do
# NOT delete terms that are part of the assumed reference model, rather we interpret them in 
# the context of the reference model (assuming that is the best estimate of the MSE), starting
# with the most complex higher order or interaction term. In an observational context, the 
# interaction is not significant and not part of any assumed design model nor is it crucial
# to the research question, so we can follow the principle of parsimony and delete it to give
# a simpler model:

SmokersBabies.ancova3 <- aov(Birthweight ~ Gestation + Smoker, contrasts=list(Smoker=contr.treatment))

# Examine the summary for the final model and (something we probably should have started doing 
# a little earlier in the process), check the assumptions:

summary(SmokersBabies.ancova3)
plot(SmokersBabies.ancova3, which=c(1,2,4,5))

# No real problems with the plots and all the terms are now significant, so a model with parallel
# lines is required, rather than a single simple linear regression model for the two groups:

coef(SmokersBabies.ancova3)
summary.lm(SmokersBabies.ancova3)

# Note that I requested treatment coding for the Smoker "factor" and by default the first 
# treatment is used as the reference category, which in the case of Smoker will be the "N"
# category:

contr.treatment(2)
levels(Smoker)

# Conclusion - Given similar Gestation periods, the babies of mothers who Smoke have on average
# about 245 grams less Birthweight than the babies of mothers who don't Smoke. Note that in the 
# context of the larger epidemiological study of which this dataset is but a subset, that this
# is definitely considered to be a poor outcome for the babies of mothers who Smoke, as low 
# birthweight is strongly associated with a number of poor health outcomes.

# Note, that if I hadn't requested treatment contrasts, the default category would have depended
# on the version of S-Plus or R. This default can be checked and, if necessary changed:

temp <- options()                                # store the current options
temp$contrasts                                   # display the stored default contrasts
levels(Smoker)                                   # display the levels of Smoker
contrasts(Smoker)                                # display the default coding for these levels
options(contrasts=c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))  # reset the default coding to sum contrasts 
# see help(contrasts) and help(contr.treatment) etc for further details of contrast options.
contrasts(Smoker)                                # display treatment coding for Smoker
options(temp)                                    # reset the options back to the stored defaults
