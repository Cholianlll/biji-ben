# Note an even better Poisson GLM is found by still fixing the history totals by including a history main effect
# (which was significant in the full model diabetes.glm, but which has been excluded from diabetes.glm2), however
# this model does not correspond to any of the models actually fitted in the brick:

diabetes.glm3 <- glm(diabetes ~ history + age*insulin, family=poisson)

# This is slightly, but definitely not significantly under-dispersed:
