#The estimates are similar but the standard errors are a slightly smaller. The estimates between the two models do not change much. 
#The reason for this is that year and rainfall are not very highly correlated. 
#The standard errors are smaller because the additional variable (year) is an important variable.

# p-value = 0.0016 soreject null. 
# interaction coefficient -0.0806 indicates that the effect of rainfall on yield is smaller for years closer to 1927.
