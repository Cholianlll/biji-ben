# Graph 1: Joyplots!

* Creator: Henrik Lindberg
* Source: Twitter, https://twitter.com/hnrklndbrg/status/883675698300420098
* Codes: https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub/blob/master/sports-time-of-day/2_gen_chart.R

```{r g1}
library(grid)
library(png)
img <- readPNG("./Figs-a/joyplots.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

* Comments:
    + Although joyplot's predecessor aka *frequency trail* was first introduced by Brendan Gregg in 2013 [^1], it was Henrik's tweet this year really made it popular again. The joyplot consists of a series of partially overlapping distribution plots, instead of traditionally plotting them in grids (inefficient for comparing), or overlapping in the same plot (pure madness in this case).
    + It sacrafices part of overlapped information in exchange of a clear comparison. The creator also uses two different tones of blue to strengthen the comparison. From a reader's view point, it feels like overlooking a range of mountains from a distance. *One cannot unsee what has been seen.* Intuitively, the reader would have an impression of which "peak" is the highest, etc.
    + Since parts of distributions are overlapped, one can never know a "valley" behind a "peak".
    + Inspired by Luis Carli's animated explainer [^2], we believe a better version of joyplot is the one can modify viewing angle so that not only its advantage retains, but also the information loss is minimized.
    + Joyplots are now renamed as "Ridgeline Plots" and are available in the `ggridges` [^3] package.

# Graph 2: A Day in the Life of Americans

```{r g2}
img <- readPNG("./Figs-a/day-of-american.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

* Comments:
    + The highlight of this animated chart is that it visualizes time series data as moving dots. One major advantage of doing so is that, at a certain time point, we can directly know people are switching one activity to another.
    + Another benifit is, no matter what time it is, we can clearly determine what activities are "on trend".
    + Putting travelling in the center of this plot is a good choice since most of activities happen in different locations. A transition is temporary but necessary.
    + Also, an option on the left hand side controls the simulation speed.
    + An improvement could be accomplished if we use fewer types of activities. Some of them are really not that typically (e.g. volunteering), and some are included within others (e.g. making a phone call is usually job-related).

# Graph 3: Violent crime in Houston

* Creator: David Kahle and Hadley Wickham

```{r g3}
img <- readPNG("./Figs-a/houston.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

* Comments:
    + The best way to display spatial data is to plot them on a map. 
    + Left:
        + Violent crimes are plotted in colored dots with different sizes. Larger points indicate the level of that crime is more severe.
        + It seems that Aggravated Assault is the most common violent crime in Houston, but this might be misleading. When the number of points plotted gets large, overlapping becomes a problem. Robbery in fact is a prevailing crime, but it is masked by Aggravated Assault's larger points.
    + Right:
        + When plotted as binned squares, the overlapping problem is alleviated. However, on the other hand, it lacks precision because a binned square is an aggregation of several crimes of the same type, so we won't know the exact location of a particular crime.
    + Basically spatial data plotting is a double-edged sword. If we want to precisely locate a data, we need to use points. If we really need to see the overall situation, a method of proximity is helpful.

# Graph 4: Pop vs Soda

* Creator: Alan McConchie
* Source: The Pop vs Soda Page Project, http://www.popvssoda.com/

```{r g4}
img <- readPNG("./Figs-a/pop-soda.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

* Comments:
    + The creator uses three bright colors to represent three mainstream ways to call carbonated beverages.
    + The usage of gradient colors is definitely a pro, so the gradual transition from one major naming to another looks more consistent.
    + But the rich variety of colors in this map is also overwhelming. All those colors are bright colors. It makes looking at this map feel like watching a cheaply made fireworks in daylight. Also we find determining the naming in Alaska quite irritating since the colors of that part is not as extreme as others.
    + An improvement suggestion is actually embedded in the same page. If we switch the coloring from cyan/magenta/yellow to r/g/b, everything looks better.

# Graph 5: Twenty Years of the NBA Redrafted

```{r g5}
img <- readPNG("./Figs-a/redraft.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

* Comments:
    + The heatmap of Value over Replacement Player (VORP) of NBA players underlines the discrepancy of reality and public's expectations of NBA players.
    + Generally, players drafted at a higher rank tend to have a more prosperous career (with relatively higher VORP). In fact, the redrafted version of this heatmap should be a perfect spectrum.
    + But the magic of this statistical graph is not telling you anything as a whole. It really lures you to click on a certain block and see the details of that player. One might wonder, why is this 2nd-round-pick player ended up with such a high VORP, or who is the bust in 1998â€™s draft? Questions like this are the real goal of the data journalism, they simply encourage readers to raise questions and continue to read the article.
    + Some traditional graphs such as scatterplot and bar plots are also provided in the later part of the original article. And readers can answer their questions via reading the rest.
