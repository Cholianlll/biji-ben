Graphical Data Analysis


Tutorial 1


 1.  Create the data matrix z using

	z <- cbind(evap.y,evap.x)

Explore the air temperature data in z[,5:7].  Create histograms of each
of the three variables and then create the three scatterplots of pairs
of variables.  Use the scatterplot matrix and spinning facility in
brush (to see the points initially, select a large brush, persistent
brushing and then brush one entire plot; when you have the basic
structure, return to transient brushing with a smaller brush) to
explore this data.  Make sure you try all the spinning and brushing
options to familiarise yourselves with their effects.  Do not print
many copies of the spin and brush windows but be sure to print at least
one situation so that you are familiar with use of the the printer.
Try to give a concise verbal description of the data.

2.  Repeat Question 1 with the relative humidity data in z[,8:10].
