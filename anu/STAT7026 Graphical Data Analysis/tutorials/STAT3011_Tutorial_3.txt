1. Dolkart, Halpern and Perlman (1971) compared the circulating
antibody responses in normal, alloxan diabetic and insulin-treated
diabetic mice injected with bovine serum albumin.  Animals were bled
from the orbital sinus and the serum analysed for antigen binding
capacity of BSA, glucose concentration and serum proteins.  BSA was
iodinated with I-131 and the antigen binding capacity of each serum
sample was determined as micrograms of BSA nitrogen bound by 1 ml of
undiluted serum.  The results are contained in a list called antibody
with components normal, diabetic and insulin.  Describe and compare the
nitrogen binding capacities of the three groups.
