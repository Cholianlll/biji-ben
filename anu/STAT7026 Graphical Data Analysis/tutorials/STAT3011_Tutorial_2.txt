Graphical Data Analysis

Tutorial 2

This tutorial is intended to enable you to explore some of the ways of
representing and comparing distributions.

1.  The data matrix ozone contains the maximum daily ozone
concentrations (in ppb) at Stamford, Connecticut and Yonkers, New York
for the period 1 May to 30 September, 1974.  Compare the distributions
of maximum daily ozone concentration at the two centres.   Try to give
a concise verbal description of the data. (Clearly, in this question we
are ignoring the time-structure of the data - we might like to reflect
more on this later in the course.)

2. The data matrix nickel contains measurements of the weights (gm) of
five samples of 40 Canadian nickels (5c) from the five years
1977-1981.  The official weight of the nickel is 4.53 gm.  However, the
variability in weight and the way this changes from year to year are of
particular interest.  Compare the distributions of weights from the
five years.   Try to give a concise verbal description of the data.
