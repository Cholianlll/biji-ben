Tutorial 4

This tutorial is intended to enable you to explore ways of
investigating relationships between variables.

1. Accelerated life testing for studying product life involves
subjecting the product to conditions that are more severe than normal
so that shorter lives than normal are observed. The data obtained under
these extreme conditions are then extrapolated back to describe the
life distribution under normal conditions.  This type of testing offers
a saving in time and cost over testing at normal conditions and makes
it feasible to explore the product life of products which survive
prohibitively long times under normal conditions.

The time to breakdown of an electrical insulating fluid at each test
voltage is given in a list called test.  Explore and describe the
relationship between the time to breakdown and voltage.

2. The agar diffusion method is the basis for many techniques for
measuring the potency of antibiotics.  Disks containing varying amounts
of antibiotic are placed in a carpet of growing bacteria so that the
diffusing antibiotic kills bacteria in a circular area called the kill
zone around the disk.  The potency of a test preparation is compared
with that of a standard antibiotic by comparing both in a single study
and estimating equivalent doses of the two.  Data on a standard
preparation to explore the relationship between zone diameter and the
concentration of the antibiotic are presented below, and are available
in the R object agar.

Explore and describe the relationship between zone diameter and
concentration of antibiotic.

Suppose that a single disk dosed with 0.2 mu/ml of a test antibiotic of
unknown potency yielded a zone diameter of 16.3 mm.   What would you
estimate as the potency of the test preparation relative to the
standard?  Is it more or less potent and by what factor?
