Tutorial 7


This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the analysis of time
series data.

1.  The annual number of lynx trappings in the Mackenzie River
District  of North-West Canada from 1821 to 1934 are stored in a time
series object called lynx.  Analyse this series.

(Note: you will be unable to decompose this series using stl because
stl expects data with more than one observation per year. If you try
to use stl, you will get a cryptic message which means, simply, that
stl cannot by used for annual data.)


2.  Monthly observations on the carbon dioxide concentration in parts
per million (ppm) at Mauna Loa from January 1959 to December 1990 are
stored in a time series object called co2.  Analyse the components of
this series.
