GRAPHICAL DATA ANALYSIS
TUTORIAL 6
SAMPLE SOLUTION

Question 1.

We start by having a look at a scatterplot matrix of the entire data:
  
  pairs(cbind(indus$y,indus$x),panel=function(x,y){points(x,y);
                        abline(rlm(y~x,method=wt.huber))})

First we examine the covariates, noting all features of interest.  
These include:
  
  Explanatory variables on raw scales:
a) strong linear relationship between fatty acid and glycerine
- most likely we will reduce the dimension of the covariate space by
not using one of these two variables

b) one observation each for 2 & 3 startups

c) 2 occasions when number of operating days = 11; same data as for few 
startups

d) Calendar days is a highly discrete variable, with most observations having
values 30 or 31. It is unlikely this variable will be terribly useful in 
explaining the response.

It is worth investigating the covariate space for multicollinearity; we have
already seen the potential for reducing the covariate space by at least one
variable (either fatty acid or glycerine)

library(MASS)
w <- sweep(indus$x,2,apply(indus$x,2,mean))
w <- w %*% diag(1/sqrt(diag(crossprod(w))))
s <- prcomp(w)
s$sdev[1]/s$sdev
[1] 1.000000 1.109512 1.788665 2.396854 3.105468 3.855555 5.562012 9.954579

There does appear to be some evidence of multicollinearity (probably due to
the presence of the fatty acid/glycerine relationship). We will delete one
of these variables (fatty acid) and see if the problem disappears:
  
x <- indus$x[,-1]
w <- sweep(x,2,apply(x,2,mean))
w <- w %*% diag(1/sqrt(diag(crossprod(w))))
s <- prcomp(w)
s$sdev[1]/s$sdev
[1] 1.000000 1.070808 1.636937 2.175511 2.813343 4.114102 5.189609

This seems to solve the multicollinearity problem. There do not seem to be 
any other problematic relationships.

It is sometimes helpful to examine relationships with the response variable:
  
a) weak, positive relationships with glycerine and fatty acid
b) negative linear relationship with av air temp

There are some other reasonably weak-looking relationships, but the ones 
mentioned here seem to be the most obvious ones from the scatterplot matrix.
Note though that there may be other relationships which are not visible
in the particular projections used here.

The next strategy is probably to go ahead and fit the full model, including
all variables except calendar days.

       all variables on raw scale except calendar days")

mod$coef
(Intercept) Fatty Acid Glycerine   Wind km/h Operating Days Freezing Days 
3.078214  0.9683927 -4.315214 -0.02263337     0.09542142  -0.009163171
Temperature   Startups 
-0.07309994 -0.1385763

(Note that Glycerine has a large negative coefficient, despite the positive
 slope of its relationship with the response noted in the scatterplot matrix.
 This effect is due entirely to its collinear relationship with fatty acid.) 

Diagnostic plots of this model shows that there is a roughly constant variation
in residuals with fitted values (extreme points 11 & 23 are downweighted)

The quantile-quantile plot is slightly short-tailed, with extreme values in
lower tail corresponding to downweighted observations

We can calculate some t-values for this data as follows:
  
  s <- mad(mod$resid)
eta <- sum(abs(mod$resid) <= 1.345*s)/(25)
tau <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s)<=1.345,mod$resid/s,1.345)^2)/17
se <- s^2*tau*(eta+(8/25)*(1-eta))/(eta^3)
lam <- 2*eta/tau
v <- se*solve(crossprod(cbind(1,x)))
tstats <- mod$coef/sqrt(diag(v))
qfull <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s)<=1.345,(mod$resid/s)^2/2,
                    1.345*abs(mod$resid/s)-1.345^2/2))

tstats

4.340571    1.91004 -1.120423 -0.804132       2.551551    -0.7722236
Temperature  Startups
-5.480014 -1.511009

Several variables can be removed from the model on the basis of their
t-statistics: we may be able to delete Fatty Acid, Glycerine, Wind speed, 
Freezing Days and Startup Days:
  
  x <- indus$x[,-c(1:4,6,8)]
mod0 <- rlm(indus$y~x)
qnull <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod0$resid/s)<=1.345,(mod0$resid/s)^2/2,
                    1.345*abs(mod0$resid/s)-1.345^2/2))
(qnull-qfull)*lam/5
[1] 1.845515
1-pf((qnull-qfull)*lam/5,5,17)
[1] 0.1574742

The result is non-significant at 5 and 10%, so we can delete the 5 variables 
mentioned above. The model now involves only Operating Days and Temperature.
Removing variables on the basis of their t-statistics is a risky move, mainly
because of the fact that t-statistics are to be interpreted marginally, and
the presence of collinearity in the data can make it hard to make decisions
that are essentially joint using a marginal-based method. We can also try a
stepwise approach. 

Model simplification:
  A series of models were fitted, successively eliminating from the model those
variables with the smallest t-statistics until the F-test for the hypothesis
that all these variables can be removed becomes significant at the 5% level.

Start by trying to delete Freezing days:
  
  x <- indus$x[,-c(4,6)]
mod <- rlm(indus$y~x)
qnull <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s)<=1.345,(mod$resid/s)^2/2,
                    1.345*abs(mod$resid/s)-1.345^2/2))

1-pf((qnull-qfull)*lam/1,1,17)
[1] 0.5252205

Clearly, non-significant: Freezing Days deleted. Now calculate t-stats
for the new model and find our next candidate for deletion:
  
  s1 <- mad(mod$resid)
eta <- sum(abs(mod$resid) <= 1.345*s1)/(25)
tau <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s1)<=1.345,mod$resid/s1,1.345)^2)/18
se <- s1^2*tau*(eta+(7/25)*(1-eta))/(eta^3)

Now try to delete wind:
  
  x <- indus$x[,-c(3,4,6)]
mod <- rlm(indus$y~x)
qnull <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s)<=1.345,(mod$resid/s)^2/2,

[1] 0.2936511

Again non-significant: delete wind from the model. Calculate t-stats:

The next candidate for deletion is Glycerine:

Non-significant: Glycerine is deleted from the model. Calculate t-stats:
  s1 <- mad(mod$resid)
eta <- sum(abs(mod$resid) <= 1.345*s1)/(25)
tau <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s1)<=1.345,mod$resid/s1,1.345)^2)/20

Next, try to delete Startups:
  
  x <- indus$x[,-c(2,3,4,6,8)]
mod <- rlm(indus$y~x)
qnull <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s)<=1.345,(mod$resid/s)^2/2,

Non-significant: delete Startups. Check t-stats:
  s1 <- mad(mod$resid)
eta <- sum(abs(mod$resid) <= 1.345*s1)/(25)
tau <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s1)<=1.345,mod$resid/s1,1.345)^2)/21

Next candidate for deletion is Operating Days:
  
  x<- indus$x[,-c(2:6,8)]
mod <- rlm(indus$y~x)
qnull <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s)<=1.345,(mod$resid/s)^2/2,

[1] 1.550798
1-pf((qnull-qfull)*lam/5,5,17)
[1] 0.2269321

Non-significant: delete Operating Days. Check t-stats:
  s1 <- mad(mod$resid)
eta <- sum(abs(mod$resid) <= 1.345*s1)/(25)
tau <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s1)<=1.345,mod$resid/s1,1.345)^2)/22
se <- s1^2*tau*(eta+(3/25)*(1-eta))/(eta^3)
v <- se*solve(crossprod(cbind(1,x)))
tstats <- mod$coef/sqrt(diag(v))
tstats
(Intercept) Fatty Acid Temperature
7.635668   4.711364   -10.28916

Now try to delete Fatty Acids:
  
  x <- indus$x[,-c(1:6,8)]
mod <- rlm(indus$y~x)
qnull <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s)<=1.345,(mod$resid/s)^2/2,
                    1.345*abs(mod$resid/s)-1.345^2/2))

[1] 4.876729
1-pf((qnull-qfull)*lam/6,6,17)
[1] 0.004542427

The result is now significant! This means that we cannot delete Fatty 
Acids from the model, and our final model contains Fatty Acids and 
Temperature. Note that this is different from the model we produced above
by simply looking at t-stats from the full model fit. Remember: we may have 
been able to take Operating days out of the model under our original 
considerations, but we decded to keep it on the basis of its t-value being
marginally above 2.5 (t(17,0.975)=2.109816), but remember, marginal tests
are dangerous, and the backwards elimination procedure we've just implemented
is based on a sequence of (joint) F tests. We should still be careful about
our interpretation! The results of sequential testing can be troublesome,
and it may be that neither fatty acids nor operating days belong in the
model. Temperature looks safe because of its relatively high t-value.

Final Reduced Model from Stepwise Procedure.  
This model explains the variation in steam produced with fatty acids and
temperature only

The diagnostic plots from this model were very similar to those from the full
model:

x <- indus$x[,-c(2:6,8)]
mod <- rlm(indus$y~x)

plot(cbind(1,x) %*% mod$coef,mod$resid,main="Huber Residual Plot for Steam
Data",xlab="Fitted Values",ylab="Huber Residuals",sub="Model includes
temperature and fatty acids")
identify(cbind(1,x) %*% mod$coef,mod$resid,c(1:25))

plot(cbind(1,x) %*% mod$coef,abs(mod$resid),main="Absolute Huber Residual Plot
for Steam Data",xlab="Fitted Values",ylab="Absolute Huber Residuals",
sub="Model includes temperature and fatty acids")
lines(lowess(cbind(1,x) %*% mod$coef,abs(mod$resid)))

qqnorm(mod$resid,main="Quantile-Quantile Plot of Huber Residuals for Steam
Data",xlab="Gaussian Quantiles",ylab="Huber Residuals",sub="Model includes
temperature and fatty acids")

The diagnostics don't look too bad. Points 11,12,23 are downweighted
in the analysis. The residual plot shows variance that is rising with 
the fitted values, but the effect does not look too serious. The 
Q-Q plot looks fine.

Now to find the model parameters:
  
  round(mod$coef,3)
(Intercept) Fatty Acid Temperature
3.134      0.762      -0.064

s1 <- mad(mod$resid)
eta <- sum(abs(mod$resid) <= 1.345*s1)/(25)
tau <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s1)<=1.345,mod$resid/s1,1.345)^2)/22
se <- s1^2*tau*(eta+(3/25)*(1-eta))/(eta^3)
v <- se*solve(crossprod(cbind(1,x)))
tstats <- mod$coef/sqrt(diag(v))

round(sqrt(diag(v)),3)
[1] 0.410 0.162 0.006

tstats
(Intercept) Fatty Acid Temperature
7.635668   4.711364   -10.28916

Model is:
  
  
  steam (kg/month) = 3.134 + 0.762 Fatty Acid - 0.064 Temperature
(0.410)  (0.162)            (0.006)


Further exploration:
  
  To further investigate whether Operating Days should be included in
the model, we can look at an added variable plot:
  
  oper <- indus$x[,5]
mod0 <- rlm(oper~x)
plot(mod$resid,mod0$resid,main="Added Variable Plot for Operating Days",
     xlab="Residuals of Operating Days given fatty acid and temp",
     ylab="Model residuals from model with fatty acids and temp")
abline(rlm(mod0$resid~mod$resid)$coef)

The added variable plot has a small positive trend. This suggests that
Operating Days should be included in the model. We shall include it and 
see if its t-stat suggests it should be deleted:
  
  x <- indus$x[,-c(2,3,4,6,8)]
mod <- rlm(indus$y~x)
s1 <- mad(mod$resid)
eta <- sum(abs(mod$resid) <= 1.345*s1)/(25)
tau <- sum(ifelse(abs(mod$resid/s1)<=1.345,mod$resid/s1,1.345)^2)/21
se <- s1^2*tau*(eta+(4/25)*(1-eta))/(eta^3)
v <- se*solve(crossprod(cbind(1,x)))
tstats <- mod$coef/sqrt(diag(v))
tstats
(Intercept) Fatty Acid Operating Days Temperature
6.935494   2.333067        1.95437   -10.56189

qt(0.975,21)
[1] 2.079614

The t-statistic  for Operating Days is non-significant at 5%, and so we 
once again delete it from the model.

The final model is therefore as given above.

Use of the avas function suggests a quadratic term in wind may be useful in the
full model.  To explore this further a full model including this term could be
fitted, the diagnostic plots for this model checked and the model then
simplified in the same way.  The inclusion of this term results in a more
complicated model with more terms.  There is no gain in terms of diagnostic
plots, so no benefit. The results are therefore not presented here. Remember, that
to use avas in R, you will need to load library(acepack) before issuing the avas command.

Final point:
  
  It is tempting to divide steam by the number of operating day to get the
steam/day usage.  However, the covariates remain on a monthly basis -
  we would like to relate steam usage to the temperature on that day
rather than the monthly average temperature.  Thus it is
more comfortable to work on the monthly data provided.
