Tutorial 5

This tutorial is intended to enable you to investigate the relationship
between a response and several explanatory variables.

1.     Anthropologists measured the blood pressure of 39 Peruvian
Indians who had moved from isolated villages in the high Andes to
larger cities at lower altitudes to investigate the effects of such
environmental changes on blood pressure.  The data is available in a
R matrix called blood.   The systolic blood pressure may be related
to three other variables namely the fraction of life since changing
environments,  the weight and height of the subjects.

Explore and describe the relationship between the systolic blood
pressure and the explanatory variables.
