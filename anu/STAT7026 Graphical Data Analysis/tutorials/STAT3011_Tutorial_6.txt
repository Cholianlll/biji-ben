Graphical Data Analysis
Tutorial 6

This tutorial is intended to enable you to investigate the relationship
between a response and several explanatory variables.

1.  Data on the amount of steam per month (kg) used in an industrial
process is available in Splus.   The response may be related to eight
other variables namely the amount of real fatty acid in storage
(kg/month),  the glycerine production (kg/month), average wind velocity
(km/h), the number of days per month, the number of operating days per
month, the number of days below zero degrees C, the average air
temperature (degrees C) and the number of startups.  The wind velocity
is expected to be particularly important in any analysis but may not
have a linear effect on the response.

The data are stored in an R object called indus.  Explore and describe
the relationship between the amount of steam used and the explanatory
variables.
