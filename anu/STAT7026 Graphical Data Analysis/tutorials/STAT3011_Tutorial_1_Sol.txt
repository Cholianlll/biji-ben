GRAPHICAL DATA ANALYSIS
Tutorial 1
Sample Solution

This tutorial was designed for you to do some exploring in R. 

First, create the data matrix z:
  
  z <- cbind(evap.y,evap.x)

To see the scatterplot matrix, type

pairs(z[,5:7])

and to create histograms of the three variables, use

par(mfrow=c(3,1))
hist(z[,5])
hist(z[,6])
hist(z[,7])

(Here we have made no attempt to make the plots presentable by titling them
 or their axes: you should make your plots look nicer by properly titling them
 and so on. We will discuss histograms in more detail later in the course.)

To create the individual scatterplots:
  
plot(z[,5],z[,6])
plot(z[,5],z[,7])
plot(z[,6],z[,7])

(Again, no attempt has been made to make the plots presentable). The point here
is that the information in the three individual plots is already available from
the pairs plot.

To see a spinning display of the data, try:
# spinning requires either the rgl library or the Rcmdr library:
# Remember, if you need to install a library, first use (once only) 
# install.package("rgl") (for example)
library(rgl)
library(Rcmdr)

plot3d(z[,5:7])

scatter3d(z[,5],z[,6],z[,7])


To see a brushing display, try:

# you can brush by loading rggobi (you'll need to install GGobi first)

library(rggobi)
ggobi(z[,5:7])

You can repeat the above commands with the columns z[,8:10], using the
above commands. 

To summarise the data, it is enough to note at this stage that in each case 
there appears to be a strong correlation among all the variables in each 
triple. This is hardly surprising as they are all measurements on essentially
the same quantity. You should be able to spin the display to see that rather
than looking like a random point cloud in 3-d space, the data arranges itself
into a cigar-shaped cloud (more or less). This means that the data might be
well-modelled by a plane in 3-space, or, even by a line in 3-space. The main
idea here is dimension reduction --- instead of considering three variables,
is it possible to think in terms of a single variable.
