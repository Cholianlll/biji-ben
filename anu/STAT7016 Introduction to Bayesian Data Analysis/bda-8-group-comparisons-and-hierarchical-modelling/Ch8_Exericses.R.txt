#the separate means model does better than the equal means model, 15 out of the 94 hospitals have posterior predictive p-values
# close to zero.  These correspond to hospitals with zero death rates.  Furthermore, these hospitals tend to have smaller exposures
# and the variation in the posterior variance of theta is larger for these hospitals.  The variation can be reduced by using information
#from hospitals with larger exposure in a hierarchical model.  

#Bayesian hierarchical model
#hyperprior assumptions - we need prior distributions on the shape (a) and rate (b) parameter of the gamma prior for the death rates
 #We note that `a' and `b' must be positive.
#some options for the hyperprior distribution are gamma, inversegamma, uniform (on positive real line)
# we need to make sure the resultant posterior is proper if we use an improper hyperprior.  
#let's assume reasonably vague priors for `a' and `b', say a ~Gamma(0.001,0.001), b ~Gamma (0.001,0.001))

#prior assumption on theta ~Gamma(a,b)
#poisson sampling model for death counts y|theta

#Conditional on the hyperparameters `a' and `b', theta_1,...,theta_n have independent posterior distributions 
#theta_i | y, a,b) ~gamma(a+y_i, b+e_i)

#To sample from the above conditional distribution, we need draws of the hyperparameters `a' and `b' either from their joint 
#marginal posterior distribution or their conditional posterior distribution. Most likely we will need to use some MCMC sampling algorithm


#To estimate the shrinkage effect, write the posterior mean as a linear combination of the prior mean and the estimate of the mortality rate
#obtained directly from the data (y_i/e_i).  The shrinkage effect is the weight applied to the prior mean (a/b)

#There are numerous ways we could rank the hospitals, for example, by posterior mean.  Or we could simulate many random draws of theta_i
# from the posterior distribution, and count the proportion of simulations where theta_i is the maximum rate (out of all the hospitals)
#the hospital with the highest proportion is the worst performing hospital.
