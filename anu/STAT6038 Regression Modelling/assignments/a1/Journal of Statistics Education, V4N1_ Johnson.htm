<p><strong>Key Words:</strong> Multiple regression.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, and ten body circumference 
measurements (e.g., abdomen) are recorded for 252 men. Body fat, one measure of 
health, has been accurately estimated by an underwater weighing technique.  
Fitting body fat to the other measurements using multiple regression provides a 
convenient way of estimating body fat for men using only a scale and a measuring 
tape.  This dataset can be used to show students the utility of multiple 
regression and to provide         practice in model building.</p>
<h1>1.  Introduction</h1>
<p>1 A variety of popular health books suggest that readers assess their health, 
at least in part, by estimating their percentage of body fat.  <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#bailey2">Bailey 
(1994, pp. 179-186)</a>, for instance, presents tables of estimates based on 
age, gender, and various skinfold measurements obtained using a caliper.  <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#bailey">Bailey 
(1991, p.  18)</a> suggests that "15 percent fat for men and 22 percent fat for 
women are maximums for good health."  <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#behnke">Behnke 
and Wilmore (1974, pp.  66-67)</a>, <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#wilmore">Wilmore 
(1976, p. 247)</a>, <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#katch">Katch 
and McArdle (1977, pp.  120-132)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#abdel">Abdel-Malek, 
et al. (1985)</a> are other sources of predictive equations for body fat.  These 
predictive equations use    skinfold measurements, body circumference 
measurements (e.g., abdominal circumference), and, in the Abdel-Malek article, 
simply height and weight.  <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#gardner">Gardner 
and Poehlman (1993, 1994)</a> supplement these body measurements with a measure 
of physical activity to predict body density from which, as we shall see below, 
body fat can be estimated.</p>
<p>2 Such predictive equations for the determination of body fat can be 
determined through multiple regression.  A group of subjects is gathered, and 
various body measurements and an accurate estimate of the percentage of body fat 
are recorded for each.  Then body fat can be fit to the other measurements using 
multiple regression, giving, we hope, a useful predictive equation for people 
similar to the subjects. The various measurements other than body fat recorded 
on the subjects are, implicitly, ones that are easy to obtain and serve as 
proxies for body fat, which is not so easily obtained.</p>
<p>3 In the dataset provided by Dr. A. Garth Fisher (personal communication, 
October 5, 1994), age, weight, height, and 10 body circumference measurements 
are recorded for 252 men.  Each man's percentage of body fat was accurately 
estimated by an underwater weighing technique discussed below.  A complete 
listing of the variables in the dataset appears in the Appendix.</p>
<h1>2.  Determination of the Percentage of Body Fat from Underwater
 Weighing</h1>
<p>4 The percentage of body fat for an individual can be estimated from body 
density.  As an approximation, assume that the body consists of two components 
-- lean tissue and fat tissue.  Letting</p>
<pre>     D = body density, 
     W = body weight, 
     A = proportion of lean tissue, 
     B = proportion of fat tissue (so A + B = 1),
     a = density of lean tissue, and 
     b = density of fat tissue, </pre>
<p> we have</p>
<pre>     D = weight/volume 
       = W/[lean tissue volume + fat tissue volume] 
       = W/[A*W/a + B*W/b] 
       = 1/[(A/a) + (B/b)].  </pre>
<p>Solving for B we find</p>
<pre>     B = (1/D) * [ab/(a - b)] - [b/(a - b)].</pre>
<p>5 Using the estimates a = 1.10 gm/cm^3 and b = 0.90 gm/cm^3 (see <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#katch">Katch 
and McArdle 1977, p. 111</a>, or <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#wilmore">Wilmore 
1976, p. 123</a>), we come up with "Siri's equation" (<a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#siri">Siri 
1956</a>):</p>
<blockquote>Percentage of body fat (i.e., 100 * B) = 495/D - 450,</blockquote>
<p>where D is in units of gm/cm^3.  The dataset provided also gives a second 
estimate of body fat due to <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#brozek">Brozek, 
Grande, Anderson, and Keys (1963, p. 137)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Percentage of body fat = 457/D - 414.2,</blockquote>
<p>which is considered accurate for "individuals in whom the body weight has 
been free from large, recent fluctuations."  There does not seem to be uniform 
agreement in the literature as to which of these two methods is best.</p>
<p>6 Volume, and hence the body density D, can be accurately measured in a 
variety of ways.  The technique of underwater weighing "computes body volume as 
the difference between body weight measured in air and weight measured during 
water submersion. In other words, body volume is equal to the loss of weight in 
water with the appropriate temperature correction for the water's density" (<a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#katch">Katch 
and McArdle 1977, p. 113</a>).  Using this technique,</p>
<pre>Body density = W/[(W - WW)/c.f. - LV],

     where

     W = weight in air (kg)
     WW = weight in water (kg)
     c.f. = water correction factor
            (equal to 1 at 39.2 degrees F because one gram of
            water occupies exactly one cm^3 at this temperature,
            equal to .997 at 76-78 degrees F)
     LV = residual lung volume (liters)</pre>
<p>(<a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#katch">Katch 
and McArdle 1977, p. 115</a>).  The dataset provided here contains the weights 
of the subjects, but not the values of the three other quantities.  Other 
methods of determining body volume are given in <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#behnke">Behnke 
and Wilmore (1974, p. 22 ff.)</a>.</p>
<h1>3.  Student Explorations</h1>
<p>7 I have presented this dataset to my students after I have discussed 
multiple regression and have illustrated, in the lab with another dataset, some 
techniques that they might try (e.g., plots of dependent versus independent 
variables, residual plots, the use of transformations of the independent 
variables in the model) when trying to build a regression model.  They work in 
pairs on the following questions after I have given them some background on the  
  variables in the dataset.</p>
<p>8 (a) Examine the data and note any unusual cases.  Sort the cases, for 
example, by height, weight, and percentage of fat and note the distributions.  
What should be done, if anything, about these unusual cases?  Suggest some rules 
for changing or deleting outliers.</p>
<blockquote>Comments: Much to the dismay of some students, there are a     few 
  apparent errors in the dataset.  Case 42, for instance,     apparently weighs 
  205 pounds, but measures only 29.5 inches     in height!  Fortunately, we can 
  infer the correct values     from other variables in the file.  The lean body 
  weight or     fat free weight of this individual is listed as 140.1     
  pounds, which is, up to rounding, (1 - fraction of body fat     using Brozek's 
  equation) * 205.  Consequently, the listed     weight is probably correct.  
  From the adiposity index of     29.9 kg/meters^2, which is weight divided by 
  height^2, one     can infer that the height should probably be 69.5 inches     
  instead of 29.5 inches (a change in just one of the digits).     One can check 
  for internal consistency between other     variables as well.  In cases 48, 
  76, and 96, for instance,     the density values do not give rise to the two 
  estimates of     body fat percentage recorded.  In each case, a change of a    
   single digit in the density gives the body fat percentages     indicated for 
  that individual.  In particular, it seems that     the following changes 
  (among others) are in order:</blockquote>
<pre>                 Listed        Apparently Correct
     Case     Body Density        Body Density
     ----     ------------     ------------------
      48          1.0665             1.0865
      76          1.0666             1.0566
      96          1.0991             1.0591

     </pre>
<blockquote>Such errors help students become more aware of data     integrity 
  issues.  Also note that case 182 is a particularly     lean individual whose 
  predicted percentage of body fat is     negative according to Siri's and 
  Brozek's equation and has     been truncated to zero in the 
dataset.</blockquote>
<p>9 (b) Choose one of the two percentage of body fat estimates,  either 
Brozek's method or Siri's method.  Fit this percentage of body fat in terms of 
some subset of the remaining variables excluding density, which is not easily 
measured.  The researchers who collected these data, <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#penrose">Penrose, 
Nelson, and Fisher (1985)</a>, built a regression model for fat free weight = (1 
- fraction of body fat) * weight that used the variables weight, age, age^2, 
height, and  (abdomen - wrist).  Do you find any of these variables useful in
 fitting percentage of body fat?  September 14, 1995 articles in <cite>The New 
England Journal of Medicine</cite> link high values of the adiposity index 
(weight/height^2), sometimes called the body mass index, to increased risk of 
premature death.  See if this variable is useful in your model.  Also try 
weight^1.2/height^3.3 as suggested in <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#abdel">Abdel-Malek, 
et al. (1985)</a>.  Why should one bother to fit percentage of body fat using 
these other variables?</p>
<p>10 (c) (This question requires a tape measure and/or a scale.)    Estimate 
the percentage of body fat for each member of your group using your regression 
model.  Is this model appropriate for all the members of your group?  How about 
for other people in class?  What is the most general audience to which your 
model can be applied?  (Note: 1 inch = 2.54 cm.)</p>
<blockquote>Comment: Most students see that the model should not be      used 
  for women; other students get into more subtle issues      regarding the age 
  of college students compared to the age of      the men in the 
dataset.</blockquote>
<p>11 (d) Comment on the accuracy of your model.  Discuss, in particular, what 
the standard error means.  What kind of error should a user of this model expect 
as opposed to the prediction error for those folks who were used to build the 
model?</p>
<blockquote>Comment: Before starting this lab I have already discussed      
  the "incestuous" nature of the standard error value and how      the model is 
  likely to give an error larger than the      standard error for cases that 
  were not used to build it.</blockquote>
<p>12 (e) Estimate the percentage of American men with percentage    of body fat 
less than 15% (the maximum for good health given by <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#bailey">Bailey 
(1991)</a> above).  What assumptions did you make?</p>
<p>13 (f) (Advanced) <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#penrose">Penrose, 
Nelson, and Fisher (1985)</a> built their regression model using just the first 
143 cases of the 252 cases in the dataset.  The remaining 109 cases were used to 
get a true estimate of the error of the model (c.f.  question d).  Here is an
 alternative "cross-validation" approach to error estimation I would like you to 
consider (but do not actually perform):</p>
<blockquote><strong>i.</strong> Build a regression model using all 252
 cases.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong> ii.</strong> Using the model (i.e., variables) above, 
  refit the          model coefficients using all the cases but the first        
    and record the error in body fat using this model on          the first 
case.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>iii.</strong> Repeat <strong>ii.</strong>, leaving out, in 
  turn, just the second, just          the third, ... , just the 252nd case, 
  each time          recording the error.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>iv. </strong> Compute the standard deviation of the 252 
  errors to          provide an estimate of the accuracy of the
 model.</blockquote>
<p>14 Why is the resulting error estimate (the standard deviation   in 
<strong>iv</strong>.)  a better estimate of the true error that one should 
expect in using the model than the standard error?  Discuss the advantages and 
disadvantages of this alternative cross-validation procedure compared to what 
Penrose, Nelson, and Fisher did.</p>
<p>15 In keeping with the other data analysis labs undertaken during the term, I 
serve as a resource/coach for student pairs during the class period in which 
they initially look at these data.  After this class period the student pairs 
arrange to meet outside of class to continue their analysis and eventually write 
up their findings in a polished, word-processed report.  Further details may be 
found in <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n1/datasets.johnson.html#egge">Egge, 
Foley, Haskins, and Johnson (1994, 1995)</a>.</p>
<h1>4.  Concluding Notes</h1>
<p>16 My students have enjoyed working with this dataset and, upon    hearing 
that I have a caliper and tables to estimate body fat from various skinfold 
measurements, come to me to borrow them!  I show the students a few of the 
regression models produced after the assignment is due to remind them how 
subjective the model building process is and how different people can come up 
with some rather different, but perhaps equally effective, models.</p>
