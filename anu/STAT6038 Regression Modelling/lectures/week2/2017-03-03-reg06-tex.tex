\subsection{Hypothesis Test}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Step I (Specify hypotheses)\\ 
		$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ which is a specific hypothesis\\ 
		$H_A: \beta_1 > 0$ however, is a general hypothesis.
	\item Step II (Test statistics)\\
		Estimated value $\hat{\beta_1}$.\\
		And under $H_0$, $E[\beta_1|H_0]$ is $0$. \\
		So the \[\frac{\hat{\beta_1} - E[\beta_1|H_0]}{\hat{se}(\hat{\beta_1})}\sim t_{n-2}\]
		is the standardized test statistics, where \[\hat{se}(\hat{\beta_1}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{s_{xx}}}=\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{s_{xx}}}\]
	\item Step III (Decision rule)\\
		Reject $H_0$ at $\alpha=0.05$ if observed test statistic $> t_{n-2=136, 0.95}=1.66$\\
		Note that $0.95=1-\alpha$
	\item Step IV (Calculations)\\
		Observed test statistic
		\[t=\frac{\hat{\beta_1}-0}{\hat{se}(\hat{\beta_1})}=\frac{0.007045-0}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{s_{xx}}}} = \frac{0.007045}{\sqrt{0.0259/218994.5}} = 20.48\]
	\item Step V (Conclusion)\\
		As $20.48 \gg 1.66$, reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_A$ and conclude $\beta_1>0.$\\
		So the slope of the linear regression model relating average temperature anomalies(?) to year (time) is significantly positive $\implies$ temperatures have been increasing over time!\\
\end{enumerate}

Finally, ew need to assess the analysis and the results

\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the data we used the best available to address the research question?\\ 
		(issue of the science)
	\item Is the model a good fit?\\
		(is the model not only appropriate, but also useful?)\\
		\[R^2 = \frac{SS_{Regression}}{SS_{Total}}=75.5\%\] is the coefficient of determination.\\
		Just a summary measure! better answer is look at the assumptions underlying the model and check if they are satisfied. \\
		Check the residual plots (here that means we still have a caveat!
		\begin{itemize}
			\item (!) Linear models just address association (correlation), they do not necessarily reflect causation (no measure of possible causal factors in these data).
			\item (!) Also this analysis does not necessarily rule out alternative explanations.\\
				Like time series (seasonal trend maybe?)
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In summary, model and analysis are indicative of a positive (association), an increase in global av. temp over time, but the research question is wider than that and we need to do further research (more data, more analysis).
