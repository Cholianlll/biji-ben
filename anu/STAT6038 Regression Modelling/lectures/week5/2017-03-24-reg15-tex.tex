Check Understanding Q-Q Plots (http://data.library.virginia.edu/understanding-q-q-plots/)

For normal qqplot,

\begin{itemize}
	\item if the normal quantile plot is chair-shaped, it means heavy-tailed distribution (compared to normal)
	\item if the normal quantile plot is lie-down-chair-shaped, it means light-tailed distribution (compared to normal)
	\item if the normal quantile plot is curved, it means skewed distribution (compared to normal)
\end{itemize}
