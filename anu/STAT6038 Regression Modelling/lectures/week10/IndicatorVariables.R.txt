# Indicators variables in regression

# In this example, we will use the Prostate cancer data from the Sample Assignments. 
# Assuming you have done the earlier tutorials and already run followed the instructions
# in those Assignments and run install.packages() to install the Faraway library

# library(faraway)
# help(prostate)
# vif
# help(vif)

# If you are having trouble loading the Faraway package, then I have provided
# copies of the data in a .csv file. As usual you will need to download this data
# file and store it in the current working directory or store it elsewhere and then
# tell R where to find the file by providing a full path name:

prostate <- read.csv("prostate.csv", header=T)
attach(prostate)

# If you don't load Faraway's package, you will need to also create your own vif()
# function:

vif <- function(xmatrix) {
  if (class(xmatrix) == "matrix" | class(xmatrix) == "data.frame")
    diag(solve(cor(xmatrix))) 
  else  
    diag(solve(cor(model.matrix(xmatrix)[,-1])))
  # assuming a linear model object, if not a matrix
}

# Now let's have a good look at the svi variable (BTW the Faraway help file did reveal
# that svi stands for "seminal vesicle invasion", which if you do an internet search on
# prostate cancer & svi, you will find is an indicator of whether or not the cancer has
# spread "metastatised" to areas around the prostate).

svi
unique(svi)
hist(svi)
qqnorm(svi)

plot(svi, lcavol)
plot(factor(svi), lcavol)

# We can use svi to divide our response variable into two sample groups:

lcavol.svi0 <- lcavol[svi==0]
lcavol.svi0

lcavol.svi1 <- lcavol[svi==1]
lcavol.svi1

# Here is the classic two sample t-test from a first year statistics course:

help(t.test)
t.test(lcavol.svi0, lcavol.svi1, var.equal=TRUE)

# Note the similarities with using svi as an indicator variable in a
# (simple) linear regression model:

prostate.lm <- lm(lcavol ~ svi)
plot(prostate.lm, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)

mean(lcavol.svi0)
mean(lcavol.svi1)
mean(lcavol.svi1) - mean(lcavol.svi0)

# In linear regression, we are assuming variances constant, which is the
# same as assuming equal variance in the classic two sample t-test.
# But are the two sample variances equal?

var(lcavol.svi0)
var(lcavol.svi1)

help(var.test)
var.test(lcavol.svi0, lcavol.svi1)

# Here's the t-test without the equal variance assumption, which turns
# out to be a more powerful test (larger t statistic, smaller p-value
# and narrower confidence interval):

help(t.test)
t.test(lcavol.svi0, lcavol.svi1)

# What if we now include svi in a multiple regression model:

prostate.lm2 <- lm(lcavol ~ svi + lpsa)
plot(prostate.lm2, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(prostate.lm2)
summary(prostate.lm2)
vif(prostate.lm2)

# Note the contrast between the p-value for svi in the ANOVA table
# and in the summary table of coefficients - despite the low VIFs,
# we are obviously dealing with inter-related explanatory variables:

prostate.lm2a <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa + svi)
plot(prostate.lm2a, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(prostate.lm2a)
summary(prostate.lm2a)
vif(prostate.lm2a)

# To better interpret the model, we could try a plot:

plot(lpsa, lcavol, type="n", main="Relationship between cancer tumour volume\n and prostate specific antigen test", xlab="log(PSA)", ylab="log(Cancer Volume)")
points(lpsa[svi==0],lcavol.svi0)
points(lpsa[svi==1],lcavol.svi1,pch=16)
coef(prostate.lm2a)
abline(coef(prostate.lm2a)[1],coef(prostate.lm2a)[2])
abline(coef(prostate.lm2a)[1]+coef(prostate.lm2a)[3],coef(prostate.lm2a)[2],lty=2)
legend(3.8,-0.6,c("SVI = Yes", "SVI = No "), pch=c(16,1), lty=c(2,1))
title(sub="SVI = seminal vesicle invasion")

# For obvious reasons, this is called a "parallel lines" analysis of 
# covariance model - see chapter 13 of the Faraway text (now part of
# chapter 14 in the second edition).

# What happens if we include an interaction term in the model?

prostate.lm3 <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa * svi)
plot(prostate.lm3, which=c(1,2,4))
