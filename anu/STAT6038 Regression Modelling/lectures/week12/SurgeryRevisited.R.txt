# Stepwise model regression, using the Surgery data from the "brick" 
# (example 7 from page 36 of chapter 2 of the lecture notes)

# Create the vif() function so we can use it later:

vif <- function(xmatrix) {
  if (class(xmatrix) == "matrix" | class(xmatrix) == "data.frame")
    diag(solve(cor(xmatrix))) 
  else  
    diag(solve(cor(model.matrix(xmatrix)[,-1])))
  # assuming a linear model object, if not a matrix
}

# Now let's take another look at this example - again read in and 
# attach the data and recalculate the transformed variables: 

surgery <- read.csv("surgery.csv")
surgery
attach(surgery)

# This is one of the few examples where the old S-Plus code in the brick
# will no longer work - there is no stepwise function in the current 
# versions of R:

??stepwise

# The current R equivalent is the step() function:

help(step)

# To use this function, first reorganise the data as we did earlier:

log_survival <- log(survival)
int_pe <- prog*enzyme
prog2 <- prog^2
enzyme2 <- enzyme^2

surgery.all <- data.frame(cbind(clot, prog, enzyme, liver, prog2, int_pe, enzyme2, log_survival))
pairs(surgery.all)

# Following the example in the help file, we could try:

step(lm(log_survival ~ ., data=surgery.all))

# Working through the details in the help file, we find that this model
# was actually arrived at using backward elimination. If we want to
# use forward selection, we have to set the scope argument:

surgery.loglm <- step(lm(log_survival ~ 1), scope=list(upper=as.formula("log_survival ~ clot + prog + enzyme + liver + prog2 + int_pe + enzyme2")),direction="forward")
surgery.loglm

# But this model arguably has some redundant (non-significant) terms:

plot(surgery.loglm, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(surgery.loglm)
summary(surgery.loglm)
vif(surgery.loglm)

# We could also use different settings for scope and repeat the 
# backward elimination process:

surgery.loglm <- step(lm(log_survival ~ clot + prog + enzyme + liver + prog2 + int_pe + enzyme2), scope=list(lower=as.formula("log_survival ~ 1")), direction="backward")
surgery.loglm

plot(surgery.loglm, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(surgery.loglm)
summary(surgery.loglm)
vif(surgery.loglm)

# Or, we could use a bit of both (i.e. stepwise refinement):

surgery.loglm <- step(lm(log_survival ~ 1), scope=list(upper=as.formula("log_survival ~ clot + prog + enzyme + liver + prog2 + int_pe + enzyme2")), direction="both")
surgery.loglm

plot(surgery.loglm, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(surgery.loglm)
summary(surgery.loglm)
vif(surgery.loglm)

# Which is indeed the same model we reached in the earlier example!

# Whilst it might assist with the search, step() doesn't guarantee 
# results, for example, here is how it would have performed with the
# prostate data from the sample assignment and question in Tutorial 5.

prostate <- read.csv("prostate.csv", header=T)
attach(prostate)

# This time, backward elimination doesn't produce great results:

prostate.lm <- step(lm(lcavol ~ ., data=prostate))
prostate.lm

plot(prostate.lm, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)
vif(prostate.lm)

# Stepwise does better, but still with some redundant terms:

prostate.lm <- step(lm(lcavol ~ 1), scope=list(upper=as.formula("lcavol ~ lweight + age + lbph + svi + lcp + gleason + pgg45 + lpsa")), direction="both")
prostate.lm

plot(prostate.lm, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)
vif(prostate.lm)

prostate.lm <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa + lcp + lbph + age)
anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)

prostate.lm <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa + lcp + cbind(age, lbph))
anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)

prostate.lm <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa + lcp + lbph * age)
anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)

prostate.lm <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa + lcp + age)
anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)

# Leading to the same final models you hopefully chose as answers 
# to the questions in the second sample assignment and Tutorial 5:

prostate.lm <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa + lcp)
prostate.lm

plot(prostate.lm, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(prostate.lm)
summary(prostate.lm)
vif(prostate.lm)

prostate.lm2 <- lm(lcavol ~ lpsa * lcp)
prostate.lm2

plot(prostate.lm2, which=c(1,2,4))

anova(prostate.lm2)
summary(prostate.lm2)
vif(prostate.lm2)
