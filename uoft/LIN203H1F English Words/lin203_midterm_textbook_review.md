#lin203 midterm textbook review
##1. introduction
- two reasons of the significant result of the size of English vocabulary are:
	- precision: same **denotation** but different **connotations**, connotation includes factors such as style, mood, and level of familiarity. *e.g. paternal vs. fatherly*
	- adaptability: word elements.

- why rich? - borrowed words.
- The general pattern with native and borrowed synonyms: native word is more familiar or more basic and usually shorter, while the borrowed word is more formal or more technical and longer.

##2. history
- human language: 50,000 years ago
- **comparative method** to discover their prehistory of languages
- **Indo-European**
	- the ancestor of all Indo-European languages is **Proto-Indo-European** (6,000 years ago, Southeastern Europe)
	- spread to branches, **Italic** branch includes Latin and its descendants the **Romance** languages (e.g. Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian); **Celtic** (e.g. Welsh, Irish, Scots Gaelic) and **Hellenic (Greek)** are other important branches.
- **Germanic Group** is where English was from.
	- Proto-Germanic (Northern Germany and southern Scandinavia)
	- Proto-Germanic also develops to other languages, like East Germanic, **Gothic** group. (extinct)
	- Germanic are bordered by Roman Empire, so borrowed Latin words for cultural items that were new to the Germanic tribes. (Those earliest borrowed words from Latin are practical familiar terms *wine, street, mile, pit, cheese, chalk, kitchen, dish, pepper, kettle ,cheap, pound, tile, mint...*)
	- when East Germanic disappeared, divided into **North Germanic** and **West Germanic**:
		- North Germanic: -> Viking Norse dialects -> **Old Norse** -> modern Scandinavian languages (*Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish*)
		- at this point, England was not speaking English! Celts spoke the language which developed to nowadays **Welsh**. NOTE: early Latin influence on English occurred not at that time! Even though England was part of the Roman Empire, but it was during the Celtic period, Latin influenced on Welsh. Latin influence on (the ancestor of) English occurred because of social and economic contact between the Romans and Germanic peoples on the European mainland, peoples who, on the whole, were not part of the Roman Empire.
		- West Germanic: **5th century**, Roman Empires fell, Germanic expanded. Invader were mostly from northwestern Germany (Anglo-Saxon... 4 tribes in total)
		
###Major stages of English
####Prehistoric English
- Celtic replaced by West Germanic because of invasion, but not in the west and north part of Britain.
- Germanic tribes occupying France adopted Latin, but those occupying Britain retained their own language.
- not too many written records (wood), by contrast, North Germanic (durable stone)
- **Prehistoric English period**: England converted to **Christianity**, Latin words borrowed, not only about religion, but...
	- religious: *abbot, mass, pope, priest...*
	- non-religious: *candle, cap, fennel, school, spend...*
	
####Old English(OE)
- **year 700**: substantial English texts
- **OE: 700-1100**
- OE has **inflectional endings** (this is still being used by French, Spanish... today)
- **Alfred the Great** in the 9th century: a massive campaign to revive learning by making English translations of Latin books -> the flourishing of English-language literature, standard...
- Vikings invasion, settlement...
- **cognate**: two words' origins trace back to the same word in an ancestor language. Viking Norse and OE borrowed from each other.
- **doublets**: the pairs of native and borrowed cognates are called **doublets**
- **WORKS:** *Beowulf*

####Middle English(ME)
- **ME: 1100-1500**
- **year 1066: Norman Conquest** -> OE to ME
- Normans were originally Vikings, but they spoke French
- French words (government, war and finer things) borrrowed into English: *court, duke, baron, county, crown, trial, villiage, peace, enemy, arms, battle, moat, gown, robe, emerald, diamond, geast, savory, cream, sugar.*
- most of the vowels in inflectional endings became <e>
- famous writer: Geoffrey Chaucer
- (Latin and Greek words entered English indirectly through French)

####Modern English(ModE)
- **ModE: 1500-present**
- advent of movable type -> book printing
- Renaisssance -> Latin and Greek words, and continued borrowings from French
	- Latin: *exterior, appendix, delirium, contradict, exterminate, temperature*
	- Greek: *tonic, catastrophe, anonymous, lexicon, skeleton*
- **Great Vowel Shift**: transition from ME to ModE
- at the same time, colonization brought English borrowed words from many other languages, names for animals and places from American Indian (*moose, skunk, woodchuck, Michigan, Chicago, Manhattan*), food terms from African (*yam, gumbo, banana* and new species and technologies (*kangaroo, koala, boomerang*) from Australian, unusual weather phenomena and customs (*typhoon, kowtow*) from Chinese.
- innovations: Enlgish also borrowed the rules by which those forms were related to each other. e.g. *-o-* in Grekk to form compound words.
- so far, what remained since Germanic ancestor of English: *sun, moon, lamb, life, death, mother, health, god, un-, be-, -ness, -ly, -some, -ship, -hood* etc.

##3. morphology
- **simplex** and **complex** (which has **morphological components**
- if a componennt is simplex, composed of no smaller components, it is called a **morph**. The process of dividing a word into morphs is called **parsing**

###Function of morphological components
####lexical components
- a **lexical** component is one whose function is primarily to provide meaning
- a lexical morph--the smallest, indivisible, simplex lexical component in a word--is called a **root**.

###infelctional affixes
- morphological components that are not lexical are called **affixes**.
	- prefixes
	- suffixes
	- inffixes?
- **inflectional affixes** tell such things as the number of nouns, the degree of comparison of adjectives, and the tense and person of verbs
- the set of words that vary from each other only by infelctional forms is called a **lexeme**, and the individual words are **word forms** of that lexeme
- **stem**: a term for the base to which an inflectional affix is attached

###derivational affixes
- a derivational affix can be defined as any nonlexical component that is used for turning one lexeme into another.
- some derivational affixes have meanings, other have none.
- empty morphs: no meaning

###how we make words
- affixation or suffixation
	- derivation (new lexemes)
	- inflection (or new word forms)

- compounding: combining two or more roots in the same word
	- rule 1: at least one element is more than one syllable long, the words of the compound tend to be written separately
	- rule 2: many compounds are written as a single word if they have been in the language for a while or are used very commonly

- conversion: word to be converted from one part of speech to another, without making any visible or audible change.
	- also called **zero derivation**
	- N -> V, V -> N, A -> V, A -> N, ADV -> V...

- clipping: the process of extracting chunks of words to stand for the whole.
	- auto -> automobile
	- bus -> omnibus
	- lab -> laboratory

- blends: words formed from parts of two or more words.
	- smog = smoke + fog
	- billion = bi + million
	- homophobia = homosexual + phobia
	- pixel = pictures + element
	- lit crit = literary + criticism
	- *the difference between a blend and compound is that in a blend, one or both of the components are clipped. Blends in which the compounents overlap in pronunciation or spelling are especially popular. For example, in sexploitation, one cannot say where sex leaves off and exploitation begins: the -ex- could belong to either.*

- initialisms and acronyms
	- initialism: initial letters to form words: USA, GAO, IBM, WWW, OK = Oll Korrect
		- difference between initialism and abbreviation: abbreviations are intended to be pronounced in full when read out loud, whereas an initialism has a pronunciation of its own, the concatenation of the names of its component letters.
	- acronym: some initialisms are read off by the sounds of their letters rather than by the names of their letters.
		- scuba = self-contained underwater breathing apparatus
		- Qantas = Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services

- onomatopoeia: a word attempts to mimic the sound it describes, or occasionally the object that makes the sound
	- *pow, creak, blip, flap, bleat, cuckoo, bobwhite, cough, babble*

- sound symbolism: the connection between the sound of the word and its meaning is less direct.
	- *putrid, foul, mother, teeny, humongous*

- back-formation
	- famous example: first *edition* and *editor*, then *edit*

##4. allomorphy
- the morphs with the same function and similar pronunciation, can be though of as variant forms of the same thing, is called a **morpheme**
- morphs that are forms of the same morpheme are called **allomorphs**
- morphs must have the follwoing properties befroe they can be considered allmorphs of the same morpheme:
	- allomoprhs of the same morpheme all have the same function
	- the choice of allomorph depends on other morph(s) i nthe word
	- allomorphs share a common history and similar pronunciation

- two main sources of allomorphy:
	- **morph split**: have different forms as the language changes
	- **morphemic merger**: originally a sequence of morphs comes to be reinterpreted as a single morph.

##5. phonetics
- basics of sound production (parts)
- manner of articulation
- place of articulation
- vowels
- ...
