- discuss how these words came to have two opposite meanings, and compare them to *cleave*.

- fast:
	- means 'fixed in one place' (e.g., stuck fast in the ground)
	- means 'moving rapidly' (e.g, walking very fast)
	
- sanction:
	- means 'allow' (e.g., I refuse to sanction this immoral behaviour.)
	- means 'punish' (e.g., The U.N. voted to sanction North Korea's polices.)
	
- cleave:
	- means 'cut into pieces' (e.g., The deli attendant cleaves up a block of cheese)
	- means 'cling tightly' (e.g., The translator cleaves to the text's literal meaning.)
	

Check OED.

- 600-800 words
- describe the history of fast and sanction
- what type or types of semantic change caused them to develop opposite meanings? was metaphor or metonymy involved? weakening, strengthening, narrowing, widening, etc?
- for each word, is one of the two meanings ultimately derived from the other, or do both meanings derive from an earlier third meaning? or something else?
- compare cleave with fast and sanction. should cleave be considered to be in the same category as fast and sanction? does it make sense to consider it a contronym too? why or why not?

##fast
Firstly, we have to clarify that for the word *fast*, we are going to trace back its history as an adverb, though it can be used as a noun, a verb or an adjective in certain scenarios. And more specifically, even *fast* is a contronym as an adjective, which has two opposite meanings, however, the meaning of 'rapid' was transferred from the development of adverb (Oxford University:2014).

The word *fast* in Modern English originated from Old Germanic *fastu-*. Its original meaning was 'in a fast manner, so as not to be moved or shaken; firmly, fixedly'. Gradually, *fast* added the meanings of 'expressing vigour in action: stoutly, strongly, vigorously', then 'close, hard; very near', and finally 'closely, at once, immediately.' And due to the semantic shifts above, it gained the meaning of 'quickly, rapidly, swiftly' eventually (Oxford University:2014).

Although, these semantic shifts started from around 13th century, the 'quickly' meaning belonged to Middle High German *vaste* and Old Norse *fast* at the beginning (Oxford University:2014).

In my opinion, the type of semantic change involved is metaphor, which can be explained by the 'resemblance' between the two seemingly opposite meanings. Specifically, 'firmly' and 'closely' both have a meaning of 'tighten up'; on the other hand 'closely' and 'rapidly' both have a meaning of 'immediately'. In addition, it's hardly to be categorized as weakening, strengthening or other semantic categories.

Last but not least, the meaning of 'quickly, rapidly, swiftly' generated from its originally meaning. And I personally note down this type of semantic change as Type I for further comparison.

##sanction
We will do the comparison of two verb meanings of *sanction*. But etymologically, the noun word *sanction* was borrowed from French in 16th century, and it originated from Latin *sanctiōn-em*.

As a verb, the meaning of 'permit' appeared first in the late 18th century, which meant 'to ratify or confirm by sanction or solemn enactment; to invest with legal or sovereign authority; to make valid or binding'. Then in early 19th century, the meaning of 'to enforce (a law, legal obligation, etc.) by attaching a penalty to transgression' was added. And finally in the mid 20th century, a new meaning of 'to impose sanctions upon (a person), to penalize' appeared.

The semantic change type should be metaphor as well, since the similarity between two meanings is 'by law': we can give permission by law and we can penalize somebody by law. The category of this change is pejoration as it changed from positive to negative somehow.

And similarly, the later meaning originated from the former; in other words, it's a Type I semantic change as well.

##cleave
In OED, the verb word *cleave* has two main meanings: one is 'to part or divide by a cutting blow; to hew asunder; to split', the other is 'to stick fast or adhere, as by a glutinous surface, to (†on, upon, in.)'.

Etymologically, the two words of *cleave* have two different stories. The 'cutting' *cleave* was from Common Germanic, also has corresponding morphemes in pre-Germanic as *gleubh-*, in Greek as *γλυϕ-* 'to cut with a knife, carve', and in Latin *glūb-* 'to peel, flay'. However, the 'sticking' *cleave* was from a prevailing form of a word meaning 'adhere' in Old Germanic. And the change of the form of this *cleave* happened throughout the history and finally had a steady form as *cleave*.

Therefore, the word *cleave* should not be considered in the same category as *fast* and *sanction* (i.e., not the Type I semantic change mentioned above), because the two distinct meanings have two different origins. Technically speaking, this should not even to considered as a semantic change; a better way to conclude this phenomenon is to take *cleave* as a *polysemy*, which stands for a word with different meanings from different origins.

Hence, *cleave* is not a contronym as itself is not a single word, but two different words with the same form(spelling).
