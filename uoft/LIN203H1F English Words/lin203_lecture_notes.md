##Lecture 1 Introduction
*September 9, 2014*

Why 'English' words?

- English takes words from other languages. (pretty nifty)
- widely spoken (the greatest number of total speakers)
- functions as an international language, used as a medium of communication between people with different backgrounds
	- a '[lingua franca](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=lingua+franca&submit.x=39&submit.y=35)' is a language, by default, for which people assume other people can speak. e.g. English is the 'lingua franca' of air/flight control.

how does English become the 'lingua franca' in the cross-culture background?

- colonization in 17-18 centuries (British Empire as a leading role in culture and science)
- the US, cultural/economical influence in the past 300 years. (300? srsly?)

as well, a notable feature of English is the:

> vocabulary

- 500,000 words for the most complete English dictionary. 'greatest number' than any other languages
- 'borrowing' words from other languages.
	- $$loanwords \neq native$$ 

> **Accord**ing to some **estimate**s, as much as seventy **percent** of the **vocabulary** of English (though a smaller **percent**age of the most **frequent**ly **use**d words) **consist**s of loanwords -- words that borrowed into the **language**.

The loanwords in the sentence above is highlighted. (In this sentence, the percentage is around 30%)

If 70% is true, why the percentage in this sentence is such low?

- Because some words in English is commonly used (more frequently than others), like 'the''as''to', etc. And in fact, we cannot live without these words, i.e., simply speaking, you cannot say a sentence with words borrowed into English only.

What makes English borrow words from other tongues?

- Sometimes, we DO need to borrow (the words in other language already existed)
	- e.g., the word *'karaoke* is borrowed from Japanese.
	- *'pizza'* from Italian
	- *'skunk* from Abanaki
	
- sometimes, even though already existed in English (as native words)
	- e.g. *paternal* is borrowed, even though *fatherly* already existed in English. basically they have the same meaning, but still a little bit different. (this is one of the function English borrows other languages for)
	- the loanwords tend to be more technical and abstract, the native words however are more informal
	- e.g.
	
|loanword	|native word|
|:-			|:-			|
|paternal	|fatherly	|
|velocity	|speed		|
|depart		|leave		|
|illumination|light		|
|terminate	|end		|
|injure		|hurt		|	


- sometimes the pronunciation of loanwords are changed in English though.
	
- English does not impose too many restrictions to the word forming. e.g. long sequence of vowels, or long sequence of consonants.
- like 'strengths', 'Iowa'
- fairly flexible
- on the contrary, Japanese has restrictions that only allow...

- historical reason/circumstance: England was invaded by Vikings and Norman during the Mid Ages, so the languages those invaders used, namely Old North and French were in close contact, so would be easy for both of them borrowing words from each other.
- Shakespeare used a variety of loanwords in his works, not like that French academy making 'styles of French' which is officially the writing rule for French languages, and claimed as the protection of such language... haha :)

- vocabulary expansion (creating vs. borrowing) ----> how? this is the **CORE** of this course.

- most important mother languages of loanwords: **Latin** and **Greek**. (focus on these mostly)
- why? **Latin** was the lingua franca of educated people, it remained long after the Roman Empire... So when English became the languages scholars that used, naturally they would borrow the vocabulary that already existed and used in Latin.
- back in history, the Romans borrowed a lot of words from **Greek** due to the same reason, since at that time, 'Greek' was the lingua franca.
- conclude: 'lingua franca' of the educated vocabulary
- English has a large amount of loanwords from French (Norman Conquer), and French was a part of Latin. So English already had the model for what words derive from Latin.
- e.g. animal (La) -> animal (Fr) -> animal (En)



- more than borrowing words from languages, English likes borrowing those **'smaller elements** that make words, and these elements are called **morphemes**.
	- e.g. supraluminal (faster than light), this word in fact is not borrowed from Latin. This words is built out of smaller components, and each of them have their own meanings.
		- supra -> over; lumin -> light
		- if we know all those morphemes, why don't we use them to understand Latin? Don't forget the grammar! Knowing vocabulary is not a sufficient condition for understanding a language. And besides, many borrowed words in English have been changed in meaning, like 'bonus', in Latin, it just means 'good'. 'Expect' in Latin only means 'to wait'.

- The reason Latin and Greek words tend to have more abstract meaning, is because they were used as scientific lingua franca, and they were originally borrowed for technical and scholar communication. The other reason is, loanwords and native words have almost the same meaning, or **denotation**, but different **connotation**.
	- e.g. 'paternal' and 'fatherly' have basically the same **denotation**, but different **connotation**.
$$denotation \neq connotation$$

- native words tend to be more informal, to have fewer morphemes, fewer meaningful structures that can be separated out. e.g. 'end' cannot be broken down to smaller components, but 'terminate' = 'termin-' + '-ate'
- English has 'freely adopted' words Greek and Latin.
- the meaning after combination of morphemes *might* be different from the bare add-up of original morphemes.
	- e.g. supraluminal, it's not about 'lighting'
	- so it could be unpredictable
	- but, if we already know the meaning of spraluminal (derived word), we can still sometimes find some recognition in the derived word.
		- phil-anthrop-y, 'like humans?' --> liking human? --> donating money to others
		- so it's an example of unpredictability, but still, as said before, you got the general idea of the word

- the same morpheme might be pronounced differently in different words.
	- e.g. *'iatr'* appears in different words:
		- [psych-iatr-y](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=psychiatry&submit.x=55&submit.y=21): The branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental and emotional disorders;
		- [ped-iatr-ician](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=pediatrician&submit.x=-872&submit.y=-210);
		- [iatr-ogenic](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=iatrogenic&submit.x=-872&submit.y=-210): originated caused by medical treatment
		
		- same morpheme, different pronunciation
	- e.g. [Anglo-phile](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Anglophil&submit.x=-872&submit.y=-210)

##Lecture 2 History of English
*September 16, 2014*
###Background to the History of English

The use of 'like' as quotation originated like 50 years ago. The 'invasion' of 'like' was slowly and slowly expanding.

- There's no language decay, but just 'language change'.
- Language changes, because of people's needs.
- Old English experienced hundreds of years of changes and development, evolves to Modern English.
- Latin, however, went through different development, geographically different, became a family of languages, called **Romance Languages**, e.g. Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, French, Italian.
- Germanic Languages: Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch Yiddish, English...
- All the Germanic Languages come from **Proto-Germanic**, which is a language we do not know much right now, because it was not a written language, but still for sure existed once. (Germanic Languages have the same 'father', show the similarities to each other)
- The history of English as a separate language started in England, when the Proto-Germanic speakers moved to England. But the original speakers of Proto-Germanic did not necessarily came from England.
- The ancestor of English, Proto-Germanic itself already borrowed words from Latin. So the start of English borrowing words from Latin began long before the origin of English.

 - Proto-Germanic borrowed from Latin

|Latin	|Proto-Germanic	|English|
|:-		|:-				|:-|
|vinum	|winam			|wine|
|milia	|milya			|mile|
|cases	|kasius			|cheese|
|strata	|strato			|street|
|calx	|kalk			|chalk|
|coquina|kokina			|kitchen|

- Not only the form of words, but the meaning of these words have been changed as well.

> Stages in the Development of English and Some of Its Relatives

- Indo-European
	- Germanic
		- West Germanic

			- Portuguese
			- Romanian
	- Celtic
		- Welsh
		- Irish
		- Scots Gaelic
	- Hellenic
		- Classical Greek
			- Modern Greek
			


- The Germanic Family splits into three parts:
	- West Germanic: English, Dutch, Afrikaans, German, Yiddish.
	- North Germanic: Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish.
	- East Germanic: several extinct languages, such as Gothic. (no more spoken by people today)
	
- Dead languages: A language that no native speakers are speaking.

- Languages and languages are twisted with each other, families and families are twisted wit each other as well.

###Major stages in the history of English
####Prehistoric English

- 5th Century: Germanic tribes invade Britain, they were Jutes, Angles, Saxons, Frisians (from north to south). (mostly from Denmark and Germany today)
- The language they spoke was Proto-Germanic.
- When they landed on 'the later England', we call the language they spoke 'Prehistoric English'.
- 'Prehistoric English Period'
- Prehistoric English is the principle language of South part of England, Celtics were widely spoken in the territory where Germanic tribes did not conquer.
- English borrowed almost **NO** words from Celtics (at that time)
- English started to borrow words from Celtics long after Prehistoric English Period.

####Old English
- around the year 700
- Old English Grammar
	- **inflection**: the way words are marked to indicate their grammatical function
- Old English grammatical gender
	- OE
	
|masculine	|feminine	|neuter	|
|:-			|:-			|:-		|
|**se** stān	|**sēo** faru	|**pæt** scip|
|'**the** stone'|'**the** journey'|'**the** ship'|

- Inflection case (examples are from Modern English)
	- subject (**nominative** case): *I like dogs.*
	- object (**accusative** case): *Dog likes me.*
	- ... (**genitive** case): 
	- ... (**dative** case): 
	
	- Note: Modern English does not have cases for nouns, only for pronouns; but Latin/Prodo-Germanic have cases, Old English has cases for nouns as well.
	
- Besides **inflection cases**, Old English also has **verb agreement**.
	- example:

|	|OE|modern English|
|:-|:-|:-|	
|1st singular:|	 ic borne|	I burn|
|2nd:|pū bærnst| you burn|
|3d:| hē bærnp| he burns|
|plural:|hīe bærnap|they burn|

- **one reason (probably) that English lost cases** is, the communication with Norse spoken civilizations (they don't have it!).

#####Norse in England
loanwords from Norse in OE: egg, get, give, sill, skin, skirt, sky, they, them, their...

- OE was similar to Norse at that time, so some words are **cognate('together born')**, meaning that their origin traces back to the same word in an ancestor language.
- Some words borrowed from Norse closely resembled cognates that already existed in OE, but they often had somewhat different pronunciations and meanings. These pairs of native and borrowed cognates are called **doublets**, e.g.:

|native|Norse loan|
|:-|:-|
|shirt|skirt|
|no|nay|
|shrub|scrub|
|lend|loan|
|rear|raise|

###Middle English
- **Norman Conquest** is the end of OE.
- accuse, acquit, administer, advocate, attorney, bail, bacon, baron, beef, biscuit, blue, brown, button, chair, constable, convict, council, court, cream, crown, dance, dinner, duke, estate, evidence, fine, govern, heir, herb, jury, lamp, liberty, madam, manor, major, music, mustard, noble, oppress, paper, parliament, peasant, plea,...
- the above words are borrowed from French, which are mainly about **government, war and fine things**. (French was the administrative language of Normans)
- ME is easier to understand (only 500-600 years old, while OE is 1200 years old :))

###Early Modern English
- printing press
- Renaissance scholarship, art, literature
- colonialism and global trade
- the **Great Vowel Shift** marks the transition from ME to ModE.
	- major sound changes affected the pronunciation of **long vowels**; short vowels remained not changed between ME and Early ModE.
	- GVS is a total change to long vowel system.
	![img01](http://cl.ly/image/1e1F0T2V3247/lin2030201.jpg)
	- the Great Vowel Shift 'Ship'
	

###Summary (Timeline)
- Germanic (before ca.450): Borrowings from **Latin**, mostly words for types of *everyday objects* new to the Germanic peoples.
- Prehistoric English (ca. 450-700): More borrowings of names of *everyday objects* from **Latin**. Beginning of an influx of *ecclesiastical terms* accompanying Christianization.
- Old English (700-1100): More *literary* borrowing from **Latin**. Large influx of *everyday words* from **Viking Norse**.
- advent of writing in Latin alphabet
- invasion by Vikings in north and east
- Middle English (1100-1500): Steady flow of borrowings from *literary* **Latin** are joined by heavy borrowing from **French**, especially terms from *law, government, the military, and higher culture*.
- Norman conquest in 1066
- Modern English (1500-present): Heavy influx of *scientific* vocabulary, including many *neologisms* based on elements from **Latin** and **Greek**. Borrowings from many **other languages** with which English has had contact in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas.
- Early ModE
- GVS
- introduction of printing press
- 1800-present Present-Day English

##Lecture 3 Morphology
*September 23, 2014*

- the study of forms of words
- the sound of the word has no relation with the word's meaning.
- in general, there is not intrinsic connection between the forms of words and their meanings. but there are some words, which can be broken down to small components that do have some certain meanings.

- e.g. 'dog' is a **simplex** which cannot be broken down to smaller components.
- but 'dogs' can be broken down to 'dog' + 's', so we call it **complex**

- those small components are called **'morphs'**, the study of them is called **morphology**.
- e.g.
	- un-desirable
	- un-happy
	- un-sophisticated
	- but under is not under!
	- note: a unit of morph is not just a sequence of sound!
- we are going to talk about the difference between morphs/morphemes in next few weeks. actually the set of morphemes contains morphs.
- e.g.
	- phil-osophy
	- Anglo-phile
	- phil- and -phile are different morphs, but they are the same morpheme. looks slightly different but they have the same origin and same function.

- the meaning of morph has no relation with its length:
- e.g.: Madagascar is one morph, not 'Mad''gas''car'.
- and you cannot always add up morphs:
- e.g.: 'the' means god, 'saur' means dinosaurs, but 'thesaurus' does not mean any dinosaurs at all.

- another example:
- gentle-man (2 morphs long)
- gentle-man-ly (3 morphs long)
- un-gentle-man-ly (4 morphs long)
- un-gentle-man-li-ness (5 morphs long)

- e.g. we can tell -ceive is a morph, even though we cannot tell at a glance what they mean:
- re-ceive
- de-ceive
- per-ceive
- con-ceive

- e.g. some only contributes to the structure, not necessary to the meaning:
- digni-ty
- varie-ty
- rapidi-ty

- e.g. appendectomy = append-ectomy

###what is morph?
the smallest component that contributes to either the meaning or the structure of the word on a large scale, not necessarily to be synchronic, i.e. even if it's not obvious to the contemporary people.

such that, for 'appendectomy' = ap-pend-ec-tom-y

concurrent is not con-current, but con-curr-ent

###Free morph vs. bound morph
morphs like dog, boy, kick, berry... etc. which can stand alone as a word are **free morphs**

morphs like '-s', '-ing', 'cran-', 'dign-' have to be attached to other morphs in order to be meaningful, these are called **bound morphs**

###Content/lexical morph vs. function 
**content/lexical morphs** are also called **referential morphs**
**function morphs** doesn't embody a particular referential meaning, only contributes the shades, or say, narrowing the meaning of the words. like -ty, -s, -ing.

- in English, most words are bound function morphs, but here are some rare free function morphs: 'and', 'the', 'of'.
- lots of free content morphs, and lots of bound content morphs as well.
- English has many free content morphs, this is not very common in other languages.

###special morphs
- root + affixes
- **affixes**:
	- **prefix**(at the beginning)
	- **suffix**(at the end)
- also black is **base** of blacken, blacken is the **base** of blackening
- e.g.
	- root: black
		- add suffix -en
			- add suffix -ing
				- get blackening
- some languages also have **infix**, for example Latin. but synchronically, English does not have many infixes.
- exception example: stood + n -> stand, the 'n' in stand; abfuckingsolutely, 'fucking' is the infix.

- suffix always change the category of the word:

|suffix|category|
|:-|:-|
|-ty|N|
|-ness|N|
|-ize|V|
|-ous|Adj|
|-ly|Adv|
|de-|V|

- some prefix only attach to certain categories of words, e.g.:
- un-ware, un-do, BUT NO un-knowledge or un-deed.
- so we say un- always attach to adjective or noun.
- NOTE: un-happi-ness, is not un-happiness, but unhappy-ness.
- some words can go either way! e.g. un-lock-able

###what are different ways of word formation in English?
####Compounding
- phil-anthrop-y, both of phil- and -anthrop and roots, so they two together make a larger morph, then plus a -y suffix.
- ped-i-cure
- bi-o-sphere
- compound of two free morphs: classroom, caveman, ...
- compound of more complex morphs, each has multiple morphs: action movie
	- action = act-ion move-ie (function as a 'word')
- can also compound compound into compound, e.g.:
	- weekend concert series (although 3 words, but function as a 'word')

####ways of compounding
the mostly common way: N+N=N

|example|type|
|:-|:-|
|pickpocket|V+N=N|
|spoonfeed|N+V=V|
|stirfry|V+V=V|
|pitchblack|N+A=A|

####endocentric compound
- dog**house** is an endocentric compound, plainly speaking, a compound with a **head**.
- other examples: black**board** is a specific kind of **board**; head**ache**; stir**fry**

####exocentric compound(counter endo)
- **pick**pocket
- **red**head

####derivational affixes
compounding is adding two basis together. derivation is adding affixes to morphs.

**derivational affixes**: either keeps the meaning, or dramatically change the category of the word 

for derivational affixes, they have two types:

|class 1|class 2|
|:-|:-|
|changes in pronunciation of  base, e.g.: san-**ity**, desctruc-**tive**|don't change the pronunciation, e.g. **-ness**|
|combine with bound roots, e.g.: dign-**ity**, fugi-**tive**|mainly combine with free bases|
|mostly borrowed, e.g. from **French**/**Latin**|mostly native|

####inflectional affixes
- derivational affixes create different words, but **inflectional affixes** create different forms of the same word. they don't change the meaning of the word, only change the form.

- e.g.:

|inflection|derivation|
|:-|:-|
|govern|govern|
|governs|government|
|governed|governor|
|governing|governmental|

- English only has about 7 inflectional affixes:
- govern-**s**
- govern-**ed**
- govern-**ing**
- eat-**en**
- cookie-**s** (different from governs)
- long-**er**
- long-**est**

- all other affixes are derivational

####irregular inflection
#####partial suppletion...

##Lecture 4 Allomorphy

###what is allomorphs?
- **morph**: minimal structural component of a **particular word**
- usually, several similar morphs have **the same function and origin**
- so, seem to be **slightly different versions** of a more **abstract** entity
- we call the entity **morpheme**
- and these different morphs are **allomorphs** of the morpheme

- e.g. dogs, foxes, -s and -es are different **morphs** but the same **morpheme**

- e.g. in-, im-, il-, ir- ... 'not'. these are all **different forms** of the **same basic prefix** in-.

- the allomorph appears in a given word depends on **basic properties of the pronunciation** of the **context** the morpheme appears in.

- e.g. Greek prefix a- meaning 'not' or 'without', has the **allomorph** an- when it's **followed by** a vowel (or h).
- but in many cases, allomorph is more **idiosyncratic** and has to be learned on a **case-by-case basis**.
- e.g. most roots don't change before suffix -dom, but wise changes to wis- in the word wisdom.

- both **root morphemes** and **affixes** can have multiple allomorphs.

###how to tell two morphs are allomorphs of the same morpheme?
1. allomorphs of the same morpheme have the **same function** (and usually the same approximate **meaning**)
2. choice of **which allomorph to use** depends on **other morphemes** in the same word
3. allomorphs share a **common history** and related **pronunciation**

NB: we define morphemes from a **historical and etymological** perspective, not a **synchronic and psychological** perspective.

- principle #1 is tricky, since meanings change over time, morpheme might not have the same meaning in every word
- use #2 and #3 to clarify

e.g. in- im- and un- have the same meaning and function, but in- and im- are allomorphs of the same morpheme, and un- isn't.

why?

because the choice between in- and im- depends on **what stem it's attached to--** specifically, what sound the stem begins.

sometimes, un- can be attached to the **same** bases as in-/im-: inescapable and unescapable are both words.

another example:

path- in sympathy and pathology. same morpheme? from an etymological standpoint, yes they are; they have a common origin (Ancient Greek), the morpheme path- meant 'suffering'. and 'feeling' in sympathy and 'illness' in pathology can thus be related.

but it's a different morpheme in the word 'footpath', it has the same form, but an unrelated meaning and origin.

- **common origin** is our **principle guideline** in this class for morpheme identity.
- sometimes we can identify morphemes **through** patterns of allomorphs.

e.g. permit, commit, submit, emit, etc.

same morpheme? or just coincidentally similar? There isn't a clear element of meaning that they all share.

- can ell kit is a single morpheme because of its allomorphs:
	- has allomorph miss- when the suffix -ion is added, in all of these words: permission, commission, submission, emission, etc.
	- the fact that we see the **same alternation** between kit and miss in these words indicates that they all **share** the same morpheme.
	- on the other hand, **vomit** doesn't contain the morpheme -mit;
	- voimit + -ion produces vomition, not 'vomission'.
	- the morpheme mit- comes from the Latin for 'send', and we can see traces of that meaning in many English words, like e-mit = 'send out', transmit = 'send across', etc. --
	
another e.g.:

- -ceive in perceive, receive, deceive, etc.
	- comes from the Latin for 'take', and we can see the meaning:
		- receive = 'take back'
		- perceive = 'take through'
	- allomorph is cep- when -tion is added: perception, reception, deception.
	- note that -tion and -ion are allomorphs of the same morphemes as well!
	- this alternation is fairly distinctive, i.e. similar morphemes don't show similar allomorphs
	- the relationship between -ceive and cep- is **idiosyncratic**
	
- there are many other morphs in English derived from the **same Latin root**, though they don't have **synchronic** relationships as clear as chive~cep. we consider them all **allomorphs** of the same morpheme away.
	- cip-, as in recipe, recipient, incipient
	- cap-, as in capture, captive
	- cup-, as in occupy, concupiscent
	- cei(p)-, as in receipt, deceit
	

###why does allomorphs occur?
aka, why not a constant form?

###phonology-based allomorphy
- some sequences of **morphs** would produce **illegal combination of sounds**, so an allomorph is needed.
- e.g. foxs? illegal, so foxes is needed.
-  we use different allomorphs of the plural suffix.
-  why wise have a different allomorph in wisdom?
-  we know it has no illegal sound sequences
-  answer: this goes back to **old English** sound patterns. (which apparently does not apply any more at this moment)

- some other examples of this type (held on to this pattern):
- deep~dep-th, wide~wid-th
- but not all morphemes that go back to Old English will exhibit this allomorph; since the **rule about sound sequences** itself is not longer part of English, many morphemes have lost this alternation in some or all contexts.

- allomorph in **borrowed** morphemes often goes back to the sound system rules of the **language they were borrowed from**.
- e.g. in-, im- follow rules of Latin. but **native** prefix un- does not have such rules.
	- np, nl, nr were illegal in Latin, so we need conduct, compare, correct, collide.
	
- sometimes the **borrowed phonology** is very similar to native phonology.
- e.g.: both Greek and English have morphemes with allomorphs a and an, with a used before consonants and an before vowels:
- the English indefinite article and the Greek prefix a- 'not, without'
- the native and borrowed morphemes show similar allomorph (because of a general tendency across languages to avoid sequences of multiple consecutive vowels, when possible

- sometimes the phonological motivation of allomorph is obscured by other changes that took place after the allomorphy originated.
- e.g.: **Latin vowel weakening**
	- in early Latin, the first syllable of a word was always stressed;
	- and there were rules against certain vowels appearing in unstressed syllables.
	- so morphemes containing /a/ would be weakened to /e/ or /i/ in mid-word:
	- /e/ before **two** consonants (or /r/)
	- /i/ before **one** consonant

####Morpheme merger
- sometimes a sequence of morphs gets reinterpreted as a single morph, of ten because one of the two has no particular meaning.
- e.g.: the Latin morph corp- 'body' occurred with a **suffix** -us or -or that had no particular meaning but just created a noun stem.
- the -or /-us suffixes were reinterpreted as part of the same morph as corp-
- so we say corp- has allomorph corpor-, corpus:
- corp-ulent, corpor-ate, corpor-eal, corpus, corpus-cle
- corpor and corpus are **extended allomorph**
- other examples:
	- ten- ~ tend- 'stretch', tenuous, ex-tend
	- noc- ~ nox- 'harm', in-noc-ent, nox-ious (note that nox- is just a way of spelling noc-s-!)

- In Latin, infix -n-, -m- always merge with other morpheme.
- e.g. vinc- and vic are allomorphs of each other.
- **nasal infixes** -> **extended allomorph**
- vic- ~ vinc- 'conquer': con-vince, pro-vince; con-vic-t, vic-tor
- cub- ~ cumb- 'lie down': in-cumb-ent, succumb; in-cub-ate, suc-cub-us
- 

####Ablaut
- ablaut: changing the vowel in a root to express **verb tense**: sing~sang~sung; drive~drove~driven, etc.
- Latin and Greek inherited some use of ablaut from their ancestor language, but the purpose was often less transparent than simply forming verb tenses. thus the different ablaut 'grades' of Greek and Latin roots, i.e., the forms of the roots with different vowels, must simply be memorized as idiosyncratic allomorphs of the roots.

- the main **ablaut grades** of Greek and Latin are **e-grade, o-grade and zero-grade**

- e.g. of ablaut allomorph:
- gen- 'birth' has **o-grade** gon- and zero-grade -gn-: genital, gonad, pregnant

- sometimes a **combination** of factors can create allomorphs:
- gen- also has the allomorph na-, as in native, prenatal, etc.
- why is na- an allomorph of gen-? because...
	 - **ablaut** gives gen- the zero-grade allomorph -gn-;
	 - **extension** creates the allomorph -gna-;
	 - **phonological repair** turns gna- into na- at the beginning of a word.

####Doublets
- Since Greek, Latin, and English are all **related languages,** they have some similar-looking morphemes in common just because they all **inherited them** from their common **prehistoric ancestor**
- e.g. English mother, Latin matr- and Greek metr- look similar **not** because of any borrowing, but because they're all **inherited from the same source**. such words in related languages are called **cognates**

- often English borrows a morpheme that it already has a cognate for, or borrows two cognates from related languages.
- e.g. Latin matr- and Greek metr- are cognates of each other and English mother, but English borrowed them anyway.
- when a single language contains morphs that are cognates of each other, borrowed from related sources, they are called **doublets**. so the morphemes mother, matr- and metr- are **doublets** in English

- some doublets are **recognizalbe through their systematic similarities**, even if they are treated as distinct morphemes within English.
- e.g. at the beginning of a word, Latin /s/ often corresponds to Greek /h/:
- semi- ~ hemi- 'half': semi-circle, hemi-sphere
- sex- ~ hex- 'six': sex-tet, hexagon
- serp- ~ herp- 'creep, reptile': serp-ent, herp-etology

- other doublets in English:
- Latin ped- ~ Greek pod- 'foot': ped-icure, podiatrist
- Latin nomin- ~ Greek -onym 'name': nomin-ation, pseud-onym
- Latin dent- ~ Greek odont- 'tooth': dent-ist, peri-odont-ist
- Latin vin- ~ Greek oen- 'win': vinegar, oenophile

- another source of doublet morphs in English is **Latin and French**
- a very common pattern in English is:
- the last morpheme in a word often appears in its French form, while other morphemes use the Latin form.
- like, receive~reception:
- when cap- is the last morpheme in the word, it appears as French -ceive;
- when you add a suffix after it, it becomes the Latin -cep-

- other examples:
- 
|French form|Latin form|meaning|words|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|-fy|fac-~-fec-~-fic|'do, make'|glori-fy, glori-fic-ation|
|-le|-ul-|'little'|ang-le, ang-ul-ar|
|-tain|ten-~-tin|'hold'|re-tain, re-ten-tion|

- on the other hand, there are many French/Latin doublets that don't participate in any **synchronic** alternations in English, and aren't very similar: 
- e.g. the Latin root cad- 'fall' appears in cadence, accident, and other words.
- French chance is also derived from this root, in fact, it's a doublet for cadence, but we wouldn't call cha-in chance an allomorph of cad-;
- it doesn't have the sort of **systematic structural relationships** that make allomorph a useful concept.

##Lecture 5 Phonetics and Phonology

October 7, 2014

- allomorphy often depends upon **phonetic properties** of morphemes.
- larynx (containing the **vocal folds / vocal cords**)
	- the space between the vocal folds is **glottis**
	- vocal folds **partially open**, they vibrate as air passes over them.
	- voiced/voiceless sound
- if the airstream encounters **no significant obstacles** between larynx and lips -- **vowel**
- if **blockage** -- **consonant**

- **consonants** (two main parameters):
	- **place of articulation**: where in the vocal tract is the obstacle to airflow
	- **manner of articulation:** what type of obstacle is the airflow faced with?
		- manner of articulation can be divided into two types:
			- **obstruent**: some obstacle **blocks the whole vocal tract**; air must push through the obstacle to escape, creating turbulent noise.
				- obstruents come in **paired voiced and voiceless** versions.
			- **sonorant**: only **part of the vocal tract** is blocked; air can escape by flowing around the obstacle.
	- these two parameters + **voicing** -> s.t. we can clarify all consonants

###major obstruent manners of articulation
- **stop**
- **fricative**
- **affricate** (combination of stop and fricative, vocal tract is blocked briefly and then partially released into a narrow channel)

- e.g.: voiceless affricate = church, voiced affricate = judge, [h] is more like a voiceless fricative than anything else.

###major sonorant manners of articulation
- **nasal**: mum, noon, singing
- **lateral**: lull
- **approximant**: way, row, yes

###places of articulation used in English
- **bilabial**: two lips come together [p] [b] [m]
- **labiodental**: lower lip on the upper teeth [f] [v]
- **(inter)dental**: tip of the tongue on or between the front teeth [θ], [ð]
- **alveolar**: tip of the tongue on the alveolar ridge, the bony ridge above the upper gums [t] [d] [s] [z] [n] [l] [r]
- **postalveolar**: front of the tongue just behind the alveolar ridge, near the hard palate [ʃ], [ʒ], [tʃ], [dʒ]
- **velar**: back of the tongue on the soft palate [k], [g], [ŋ]

- we say [h] is a **glottal** fricative -- its point of articulation is **glottis**, the space between the vocal folds.
- [w] is **simultaneously bilabial and velar**
- **glottal stop** [ʔ], can be heard between the syllables of uh-oh: it's a **momentary complete closure** of the glottis.

- some additional terms:
	- **coronal**: a collective category of articulations using the tip or front of the tongue -- dental, alveolar, post alveolar, et al.
	- **sibilant**: a **coronal fricative** / affricate constricted **behind the teeth** [s z ʃ ʒ dʒ tʃ]
	

- the set of sounds that has some particular feature or features in common is referred to as a **natural class**

###vowels' natural classes
vowels are produced with no constriction in the vocal tract; the sound of vowels is determined by the overall **position of tongue and lips**

####vowel height
- distance from tongue to roof of the mouth
- high vowels have tongue close to roof of mouth... low vowels...
- heat = high, hot = low

####vowel frontness
- how far forward or back the centre of the tongue is
- Kate = front, court = back

####vowel roundness
- whether or not the lips are rounded to produce the vowel
- most back vowels are rounded
- beet = unrounded, boot = rounded

####vowel tenseness
- roughly to the amount of **tension** or **energy** in the vocal tract.
- tense rounded vowels have more tightly rounded lips than lax ones;
- tense front vowels are **fronter** than lax front vowels; etc.
- beet = tense, bit = lax
- the laxest possible vowel sound is called **schwa**, symbolized [鹅]: it's mid, central, unrounded -- lacking in energy or distinctive features
- e.g. comma, about

###English vowels
####diphthong:
- a complex vowel sound produced with the vocal tract **changing position**
- e.g. *boy* starts mid-back-rounded and ends high-front-unrounded

- diphthongs are transcribed as a **sequence of vowels**
- English has **three major diphthongs**:
- [oi], mid back rounded -> high front unrounded
- [ai], low central unrounded -> high front unrounded
- [au], low central unrounded -> high back rounded

- the **mid tense** vowels [e] face, and [o] goat are often diphthongized as well; each glides to the nearest high vowels, so we find [ei] and [ou]

- a vowel that is not a diphthong is called a **monophthong**

####stress
- a phonetic feature that applies to an entire **syllable** at once.
- stressed syllables are usually a bit **louder**, **tenser** and **longer in duration.**
- e.g.: **stress** is the feature that distinguishes between the noun and verb permit
- IPA: primary stress -> raised tick mark, secondary stress -> low tick mark

###How does phonetics affect **allomorphy**?

- a very common phonological process is **assimilation**:
- one sound **copies** some (or all) **of the phonetic features** of an **adjacent sound**

####voicing assimilation
- a voiced sound next to a voiceless sound may become voiceless itself (or vice versa)
- e.g. reg- 'rule' becomes rec- before a suffix begging with t
	- regular, interregnum but direct, direction
	- this is because the sounds [g] and [k] differ only in voicing
	- so reg- becomes rec- [g] becomes [k] to match the voicelessness of the t.
	- similar e.g.: scrib- 'write' becomes scrip before t, prescribe but prescription
	
####place (of articulation) assimilation
- a sound copies the place of articulation of an adjacent sound.
- this is particularly common with **nasal** consonants
- e.g. [n] becomes (bilabial) [m] before a bilabial consonant, in- con-, syn-:
	- in-duce, in-scribe, but im-pe, im-bibe
	- con-tend, con-serve, but compel, combine
	- syn-thetic, syn-drome, but sym-pathy, sym-bol
	
- [n] becomes [ŋ] before **belars**:
	- incubate, congregate, syncopate
	
- in both cases, the consonant remains a **nasal** but assimilates to match the place of articulation of the following consonant.

####(Sometimes) total assimilation
- a consonant just becomes an **exact copy** of whatever consonant is next to it.
- e.g.: [n] in in- and con- **totally assimilates** to a following [l] or [r]:
	- il-lusion, ir-radiate, col-lect, cor-rect

- the prefix ad- **totally assimilates** to a **whole bunch** of different consonants:
- e.g.: ap-proach, af-fect, as-sume, ar-rogant, al-leviate, an-nex, ac-claim, ag-gravate.
- notes: in general in english double consonants aren't pronounced double, the spelling is where we can see this assimilation taking place.
