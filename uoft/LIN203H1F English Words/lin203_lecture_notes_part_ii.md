##Lecture 6 Regular Allomorphy; Numeric Elements

October 21, 2014

###basic allomorphs and assimilation

e.g. frag-ile, frang-ible, we don't know which is the more 'basic'

but, for in- and im- we can distinguish that 'in-' is more 'basic'.

other related allomorphs: im-, il-, ir-, etc.

basic allomorph: the allomorph that appears when default situation (no special rule can be applied)

we write in this form:

- in -> im / __[bilabial]	
- or in -> im / __b, p, m
- in -> il / __l
- in -> ir / __r

the same rule affects other prefixes, as well.

e.g. con-duct, com-pel, col-lide, cor-rect

so we can conclude

- n -> m / __[bilabial]
- n -> l / __l
- n -> r / __r

other allomorphies based on phonology can be generalized in this way.

examples of voicing assimilation:

b -> p / __[voiceless] scrib -> scrip-t

g -> [k] / __[voiceless] reg -> di-rec-t

so we can conclude:

[voiced stops] -> [voiceless] / __[voiceless]

these are **morphophonological rules**!

en-ph -> em-phasis

syn-ph -> sym-phony

but the problem is that ph is not a bilabial sound, why n is assimilated to m?

because ph used be to a bilabial sound in ancient Greek.

**Total Assimilation of /d/**

- d -> f / __ f
- d -> n / __ n
- d -> c / __ c
- e.g:
- ac-commodate
- ac-culturate
- ac-cept a[ks]ept
- ac-cident a[ks]ident

- c -> [s] / __ [front] e, i, y
- g -> [dʒ] / __ [front] e, i, y

> the rules best applies based on spelling, even though they used to be based on sound.

- ad-cept
- ac-cept
- ac-[s]ept

or

- ad-cept
- ad-[s]ept
- a[ss]ept

which is wrong!

so the **two morphological rules applied in a specific order!**

###deletion and insertion

- the motivation is to make the sound easier or to avoid illegal sound sequences.

####/s/ deletion
s -> Ø / __ [voiced consonant]
####Vowel deletion
V -> Ø / __ (h) V

- e.g.:
- cello-ist -> cellist
- meta-onym -> metonym

####cluster simplification
C -> Ø / __ s C

C -> Ø / C __ C

fulg'lightening' + -men- + -ate -> fulminate

con-gnate

sub-spec-t -> suspect

ad-scend -> a-scend


####consonant shortening
C: -> C / {C --, -- C}

- ex- -> e-
- ex-mit
- e[ks]-mit
- e[s]-mit
- e-mit

- pre-sump-tion
- red-emp-tion
- red-und-ant

Ø -> s / b __ [voiceless stop]

- e.g.:
- ab + trac -> abstract
- sub + pend -> suspend
- subs-pend
- sus-pend


####Latin /a/&/e/ weakening
in non-initial syllables

- a -> e
- e -> i / __ C V

- suf-fac-i-ent
- suf-fec-i-ent
- suf-fic-i-ent

####Rhotacism

**Rhotacism** is the process of turning /s/ into /r/

s -> r / V __ V

- rus-tic
- rur-al
- jus-tice
- jur-y

- sal-i-ent
- re-sil-i-ent
- re-sul-t

- tag
- con-tig-uous
- con-tag-ious
- con-tac-t
- contact does not go through vowel weakening, why? no idea

##Lecture 7 Polysemy and semantic change

October 28, 2014

- **polysemy**: a single morpheme can have **multiple forms**, it can also have **multiple meanings**
- 'vagueness'
	- some morphemes have basic meanings that are slightly vague, details of the meaning are filled in by context
- a very **common** polysemy is between a **physical object & the abstract entity it represents**
- **metaphorical association**: the meaning of a word now might be **more remote** from the basic meaning of it, but they still have conceptual connection.
- free morphemes and bound morphemes can both be polysemous:
- path- 'feeling' or 'illness'
- cosm- 'world' or 'makeup'
- err- 'wander' or 'mistake'

###polysemy vs homonymy
- **homonymy**: when **distinct morphemes** with **unrelated meanings** have the **same form**.
	- e.g. bank also means 'land at the side of a river'; pool also means 'billiards game'; but these are **different morphemes** than the meanings of pool and bank above.
- **homophone** is sometimes used with the **same meaning** as **homonym**; but sometimes homophone is reserved for morphemes that are **spelled differently** but pronounced the same.
	- e.g.(sometimes) pair and pear.

- back to **homonym**, it's just a **coincidence** that two different meanings are both the same word; the two meanings have two **separate origins.**
	- e.g. (homonymous bound morphemes):
		- in- 'not' and 'in'
		- doc- 'teach' and 'opinion'
		- -s 'noun plural suffix' and 'verb agreement suffix'
		- equ- 'horse' and 'even'

- homonymy and polysemy have **different causes**:
	- homonyms have different origins, and look the same through coincidence
		- originate as loans from different sources
		- because two morphemes that were originally pronounced differently come to be pronounced the same through language change
	- polysemous meanings of a morpheme all have a common origin.
		- being generated out of earlier meanings through **semantic shift**, say **change in the meaning** of a morpheme
		- a morpheme may start with one meaning, and develop new meanings over time; and the older meanings **may or may not remain in use** as well.
		- thus **multiple meanings for a single morpheme** may coexist side by side.

###why does semantic change happen?
- a variety of causes:
	- **changes in the world** can lead to change in the meanings of words:
		- e.g., instead of creating a **new word** to refer to some new phenomenon, an old word can be used **creatively** and given a new meaning.
		- e.g., computer, mouse.
	- meanings can shift because people **use language in creative and playful ways**
		- irony, exaggeration, understatement, metaphor, etc, using words other than their literal meanings.
		- if a creative or playful usage of a word becomes **established** and **frequent**, it might become a new **conventional meaning**
		- e.g., terrific, bad -> good(now primary)
	- semantic change can be caused by **the way people learn language**:
		- in general, people don't learn the meanings of words from dictionaries
		- but through interacting with other speakers, hearing words used, and deducing their meanings from context.
		- so always has 'ambiguity'
		- can end up becoming a new meaning for the word
		- e.g., 'fix'
	- sometimes, meanings that are **implied** become a new **core meaning** for a word
		- e.g., since: 'after' -> 'because'

- drastic change:
	- nice originally means 'foolish'; silly originally means 'happy'

###common pathways of semantic shift

- usually involves some **association** between the old and new meanings -- either via **metaphor** or via **metonymy**		

####metaphorical shift
- is based on **resemblance** between old and new meanings -- a word gains a meaning that is somehow similar to the original meaning
	- the similarity can manifest in various ways:
		- literal physical similarity: leaf 'part of a tree' -> 'page of a book'
		- a similar relation to its context: foot 'bottom of the leg' -> 'bottom of the stairs'
		- a more abstract relationship:
			- grasp 'hold in the hand' -> 'understand'
			- bitter 'unpleasant-tasting' -> 'miserable and angry'
- metaphorical shift often (not always) involves a shift from a **concrete, physical** meaning to a more **abstract** or **conceptual** meaning, like grasp and bitter.
- **spatial metaphors** very common:
	- describing a concept or idea in terms of physical **directions or relationships**:
		- e.g., before originally means 'in front of', its metaphorical meaning is 'earlier'

####metonymy
- is based on some kind of connection between two entities -- using a word to refer to something that is related to the original meaning, not because of resemblance but because of some other association
	- e.g., tongue originaly means 'language'; cheek means 'jawbone', now means what's next to the jawbone; mail means 'bag' but now what's carried in a bag.
- a common type of metonymy is **synecdoche** -- using a part of something to refer to the whole, or vice, versa, or the material to refer to something that's made of it:
	- head is used to refer to the whole animal in phrases like 50 head of cattle;
	- drink can mean specifically 'drink alcohol' in addition to 'drink any fluid';
	- glass can refer to a drinking vessel that's made of glass.

- metonymy or metaphor **may depend on cultural context** -- what people at a given place and time thought made sense as a resemblance or association between two meanings may not make sense today!
- thus, once a word develops polysemy through metonymy, metaphor, etc., the different meanings can continue to exist alongside each other even if the situation that created the polysemy no longer obtains.
- from a **synchronic** standpoint, this could be thought of as a case of what was originally a single polysemous morpheme becoming two **homonyms**

		note: metaphor and metonymy aren't the only ways words can change meaning, though most commonly.

- words can lose meanings without any special change affecting them -- only needs to 'fall out of use'.
- one meaning is **obsolete**, b/c we don't use it any more, or another meaning of it becomes prominent.
	- e.g., computer is the a perfect example for both probabilities

###results of semantic shift
####categories
- narrowing: a word is specialized to refer to a subset of what it originally meant:
	- deer meant 'animal', now...
	- meat meant 'food' in general, now...
- widening: opposite to narrowing (generalized, broader)
	- bird meant 'young bird', now...
	- plant meant 'sapling' or 'seeding', now...
	- widening seems less common in English
- weakening: a word's meaning loses force or intensity:
	- soon meant 'immediately', now...
	- astonish meant 'knock unconscious', now...
- strengthening: opposite to weakening
	- kill meant 'strike', now...
	- jeopardy meant 'uncertainty', now...
	- strengthening less common than weakening, maybe because weakening depends on **exaggeration**, which is more common.
- amelioration: a word takes on a more positive connotation:
	- nice meant 'foolish', now...
	- fond meant 'foolish', now...
- pejoration: opposite to amelioration:
	- silly meant 'blissful, happy'...
	- villain meant 'peasant'...

####conclude
- more than one of these may be involved in any particular semantic shift:
	- dude meant 'a ridiculous fop' -> 'a guy' (widening and amelioration)
	- car meant 'horse-drawn wagon' -> 'wheeled vehicle' -> 'automobile' (widening and then narrowing)

- not all semantic shifts involve these particular dimension; those are just simple to identify and name.
- miscellaneous metonymy or metaphor, like tongue meaning 'language'.

##Lecture 8 Usage and variation

November 4, 2014

####What is a language exactly?
- aren't discrete and well-defined entities; boundaries are fuzzy; not always possible to e.g. count how many there are
- no two people speak exactly the same way
- can't say a language has **a consistent structure and vocabulary**, cuz (different ways to...)
- This sense of it's an **idiolect**
	- the individual way a particular person speaks, with a different grammar and vocabulary than anyone else's idiolect.
	- but it two people's idiolects are broadly similar to each other, we might say they speak 'the same language'.
	- an **abstraction** in this sense.

####How similar is similar enough?
- no one agreed-upon and well-defined standard
- a common rough definition depends on the concept of **mutual intelligibility**:
	- if two idiolects are so similar that one speaker easily understands the other, we might think of them as speaking the **same language.**
	- this is the only definition that depends **only on properties of the idiolects**
- another possible definition: agreement on a **common authority**:
	- two people speak the same language if they would consult the same source to find the name of something they don't know the right word for.
	- but isn't always **applicable**
	- not all languages have authorities, dictionaries, etc.

####What is a dialect?
- a **dialect** is an **intermediate abstraction** between 'idiolect' and 'language' -- a set of **very similar** idiolects, often associated with a given geographical area.
- dialects can be viewed on **broad or narrow scales:**
	- **Canadian English** is a dialect, compared with British, American, etc. dialects;
	- but **within** Canadian English we can speak of the **Toronto dialect,** the **Montreal dialect** (of English), the **Vancouver dialect,** etc.;
	- and within Toronto, there may be different dialects associated with **different ethnic groups ('ethnolects')**

- the difference between 'languages' and 'dialects' depends on **scale**;
- not absolute difference
- no totally satisfactory criterion for deciding whether two varieties are **dialects of the same language** or **different languages**
- the possibility of a **dialect continuum** makes mutual intelligibility **problematic** as a way of defining different languages:
	- there are **chains of dialects** where any two dialects **next to each other** are mutually intelligible, but the ones **at either end of the chain** aren't mutually intelligible with each other.
	
- **political** factors (e.g. national boundaries)
	- Norwegian, Swedish and Danish are almost mutually intelligible, but considered as 3 different languages
	- Serbian and Croatian different, but when they were part of the same country (Yugoslavia), single language
	- Urdu (spoken in Pakistan) and Hindi (spoken in India) are a similar situation
	
- thus, dialects that are very similar in linguistic terms are thought of as being different languages because of political and cultural difference.

- opposite e.g.: varieties of language that are quite different in objective terms are described as 'a single language' because they are politically or culturally united.
	- Chinese, not mutually intelligible multiple varieties, but China is a unified political state, 'dialects of Chinese'
	
	
#####can be applied to **language change over time**:
- OE is not mutually intelligible with ModE, but every stage in between is intelligible with the ones before and after it, and they all would describe themselves as speaking 'English'.
- and, the boundary between OE and ME, say Norman Conquest is really an **arbitrary** decision

- 'standard' vs' 'non-standard'

###Prescriptive vs. Descriptive
two different ways of talking about language structure and differences between dialects:

- linguists take a **descriptive** approach:
- the goal is to describe as accurately as possible the way language is used -- how sentences are structured, how sounds combine, etc, and why it is used that way.
- the descriptive approach **does not make value judgments** between dialects

- many other commentators on language take a prescriptive approach: their aim is to maintain and enforce standards on language use, defining some dialects as correct and others incorrect

- descriptive linguists don't deny the existence of standardization that people will be socially disadvantaged by speaking non-standard dialects and regarded more favourably if they use standard dialects
- but it's about society, not facts about the the dialects themselves

- **Dialects become standard because they're spoken by privileged people, not vice versa**
- Nonstandard dialects aren't inadequate or wrong in any objective sense; it's just by an arbitrary social judgement that they're considered that way.

- Prescriptivists promote several false myths about language:
	- that nonstandard dialects are **lacking in structure** or 'ungrammatical'
	- that nonstandard dialect speakers are **less intelligent**
	- that nonstandard dialect features are **illogical** or **don't make sense**
	- that **change** away from the current standard is **harmful** to the language
	- **None of these are true!**

- All dialects are equally well-structured.
