#Lecture 7 Language Acquisition

##Language Acquisition
###First language acquisition
the process involved in learning your first language (L1) as a child.

- not acquired through:

	- imitation
	- reinforcement

- evidence that children follow innate principles in language acquisition

###Second language acquisition
the process involved in learning any language (L2) after the acquisition of a first language.

- could be later in childhood
- could be on adulthood

###learned vs. acquired

**learning** involves conscious gaining of knowledge.

- how to draw a syntactic tree or tie a knot is learned knowledge.
- second languages are by and large learned.

**acquisition** involves subconscious gaining of knowledge.

- your first language is acquired.

###The poverty of the stimulus

The logical problem of language acquisition

- language learners must come up with a grammar based on the input they receive.
- the input doesn't give learners enough information to work out all the properties of the languages.
	- input contains ambiguous sentences and performance errors (mispronunciations, false starts, interruptions).
	- very little negative evidence. Children are very rarely overtly "corrected".
	- no one teaches you what the phonemes, allophones, and phonological processes of the language are.

###Innateness Hypothesis

- most linguists believe that **innate** universal principles guide children in the formation of grammar and constrain the types of grammars that create.

	- innateness would account for why there are certain **types of errors that children never make**
	- innateness explains why first language acquisition is **quick and mostly unconscious**
	- acquisition despite **poverty-of-the-stimulus**
- the universal principles, common to all languages, are **Universal Grammar (UG)**

###Children have grammars
although the words and sentences produced by small children sometimes paperer to be without any structure, children have highly strutted grammars.

in learning the adult language **children create their own grammar** which slowly evolves into the adult grammar.

both the phonological morphological, and syntactic "**errors**" produced by children are **highly predictable**, suggesting constraints.

This is true of all languages and all normally developing children. 
	
##Phonological Acquisition
###first year of speech production/perception
before being able to acquire a language, children need to have developed two types of learning.

**Types of learning**

- before birth, children have the ability to process **sensory information**
	- hearing, seeing, smelling, etc.
- at birth, children begin to acquire **motor skills**
	- by 3 months they begin to acquire the finer-motor skills used in speech articulation.

**early speech perception**

- newborns have the incredible ability to **discriminate** phonetic sounds from **all the worlds languages**.
	
	- i.e., newborns can perceive whether two sounds of any language are the same or different.
	- **upshot:** all normally developing humans are born with the ability to acquire **any** human language
	
- babies are incredible phoneticians and 'citizens of the world'

**HABITUATION-SWITCH Task**

- babies listen to a sequence e of sounds until they turn their head away for more than 2 seconds
- a flashing light redirects their attention for a few trails
- in the experimental trail, a new sound is played instead.
- if the baby reacts to the new sound, we can assume they hear the difference.

**What doe these experiments how?**

- children under 6 months have the ability to discriminate sounds.
- by 6 months, children home in on the the particular language they are learning.
- keeping statistics about the sounds they hear.
	- can no longer distinguish between sounds not found in their language.
	- they are beginning to build a **phonemic inventory**
- after 6 months infants:
	- can perceive the phonemes of their language
	- can recognize some words, including their own name.
- by 9 months:
	- can recognize phonological processes in their language.
	- can perceive words as units.
	
###First year of speech production
**Three pre-language stages of production**

- **crying** (from birth): the first pre-language communication strategy that all babies use is **crying**
	- communicates discomfort or hunger
	- to cry effectively, babies need to have control of three ingredients to language:
		- control of speech rhythm (stopping and starting)
		- control of pitch
		- control of volume
- **cooing** (2 months): by 2 months, children are at the **cooing** stage in which they experiment with making consonant-like vowel-like sounds.
	- not actual sounds of the target language (the language being learned)
	- at this stage, infants are acquiring **turn-taking**, gesturing, and interactional cues.
		- learning how to have a conservation.
- **babbling** (6 months): at about 6 months, infants are **babbling**
	- zeroing in on their target language and the sounds that they use are closer and closer to the sounds of the target language.
	- repeat the same syllables over and over.
	- by 10 months, children are only producing the sounds of their target language
		- a limited **phonemic inventory**
	- by 12 months, children begin to produce individual words in their own language.
- babbling in ASL
	- experimenting with different handshapes.
	

###order of phonological development
a child learning any language typically acquires phonemes of a language in particular orders.

- vowels < consonants
- stops < fricatives < affricates < approximants
- labials < alveolars, palatals, velars < interdentals

the more **marked** sounds are acquired last:
- more difficult to produce
- restricted to certain environments
- less common cross-linguistically

###Phonological strategies
once children are producing words, they use a number of **strategies to adapt words and sounds to their current grammars** until they can further **refine** their system to be like an adult system.

- substitution
	- stopping: fricatives are realized as stops.
	- fronting: sounds produced further back in the oral tract are articulated further front.
	- gliding: liquids are often realized as glides. typically a late development.
	- denasalization: nasal sounds are realized as their oral equivalents.
- assimilation
	- voicing: the first sound of all these words have assimilated to the voicing of the following vowel.
	- place: the first sound of all these words have assimilated the place of articulation of a consonant later in the word. (can have other kinds of assimilation as well (manner, nasal, etc.)
- syllable structure simplification
	- children simplify syllable structures in specific ways:
		- delete certain unstressed syllables
			- unstressed syllables are often deleted in early child production.
		- retention of word final unstressed syllables
			- unstressed syllables are retained are usually word final.
		- consonant cluster simplification
		- coda deletion
		- reduplication

##Morphological acquisition
###Vocabulary development
children's first words include lexical items and fixed expressions

###Word meaning
children frequently either over-extend or under-extend the meaning of words:

- overextension: when the meaning in the child's grammar is more general than the meaning in the adult grammar
	- e.g., using 'ball' to refer to all round objects, like apples
- underextension: when the meaning in the child's grammar is more specific than the meaning in the adult grammar.
	- e.g., using 'dog' to only refer to German Shepherds but not other types of dogs.
	
many linguists believe that this is actually rarer than it could be because children have particular learning **biases** that push them in prefer certain types of meanings.

- whole-object bias: expect that the first word that you hear as a name applies to the whole object, not a part
- taxonomic bias: assume that a new word applies to other objects of the same kind, not just the salient object in the context
- mutual exclusivity bias: assume that an object has only one name

###acquisition of functional morphemes
children acquiring english follow a predictable path of acquisition of the functional morphemes of english

two facts determine the order of acquisition:

**semantic complexity** and **formal complexity**

###emergence of morpho-phonological rules

the **past tense** offers evidence that children create morpho-phonological rules as they acquire language.

- at first, children acquire individual instances of past tense forms (e.g., walked, went) with no morphological break down.
- soon, they leant the morpho-phonological rule 'add /-d/ to the end of the verb'.
- however, they over-apply this rule, not just to regular verbs, but also irregular verbs, and we get forms such as goes, takes, does.
- eventually, they relearn the irregular forms (went, took, did)

we see the same pattern of acquisition of all irregular morphology in all languages:

- stage 1: case-by-case learning
- stage 2: overgeneralization
- stage 3: mastery of exceptions

best evidence for the last stage is children's ability to apply rules to words they've never heard before.

one of the most famous experiments in linguistics is the **Wug Test**:

- children are shown pictures of unknown animals, actions, or objects with made-up names and are asked to produce the plural form (or the past tense, etc.)

since children have never heard these words before, they cannot simply be imitating.

- instead, they are applying the rules they've acquired unconsciously through being exposed to language
- by ages four to five, children have mastered the morpho-phonological processes of their language

##Syntactic acquisition
children's syntax becomes increasingly complex:

- **holophrastic(one-word) stage (1-1.5 years)**:
	- children only produce one-word utterances.
	- no evidence of phrase structure.
	- children are able to manipulate intonation to express questions, command,s statements.
- **two-word stage (1.5-2 years)**:
	- still little evidence of phrase structure, but the beginnings of a syntactic grammar.
	- two word proto-sentences with word order!
- **telegraphic stage (2-2.5 years)**:
	- similar to adult speech, but lacking functional morphemes (articles, auxiliaries, inflection, etc.)
	- appears to follow phrase structure rules.

###evidence of UG
many linguists believe that underlying the process of syntactic acquisition is an innate universal grammar.

##Second Language acquisition
###critical period hypothesis
there is a window of time for language acquisition after which native-like proficiency is rarely achieved.

- furthermore, normal linguistic development requires exposure to language during the critical period.

individuals who don't experience language as children never fully acquire language.

###factors affecting L2 acquisition
- age
	- research shows that the **ultimate attainment** (i.e., the final state of acquisition) of a pre-puberty second language learner is closer to that of native speakers than that of post-puberty second language learners.
	- this is **particularly true of phonetics/phonology**, as acquiring new phonological contrasts (i.e., phonemes) becomes difficult after childhood.
	- someone speaking an L2 with their L1 phonology results in a 'foreign accent'.
		- many ESL speakers achieve syntactic/morphological fluency but retain an L2 accent.
- attitude
	- attitude can also affect success in second language acquisition
	- attitude can include:
		- toward the L2 language
		- toward speakers of the language
		- toward language-learning in general
- motivation
	- motivation affects the success and the level of ultimate attainment
	- there are different types of motivation:
		- intrinsic motivation: driven by inner goals (e.g., personal achievement, curiosity)
		- extrinsic motivation: driven by external goals (e.g., job opportunities, grades)
- cognitive style
	- cognitive styles are the different ways in which different people process information
		- someone with filed independent cognitive style tends to approach problems analytically, examine details and specifics
			- better at analytic language tasks, such as 'provide the correct grammatical form...'
			- accuracy is important
		- someone with field dependent cognitive style tends to approach problems holistically (i.e., focusing on the whole instead of sub-parts)
			- better at demonstrating communicative competence
			- fluency is important
	- some people also just have a natural ability to learn languages
- personality
	- lack of inhibition, extroversion, and even gregariousness, for instance, may lead to more participation in the second language and result in greater proficiency.
	
###whats the L2 learner doing?
beyond memorizing new words and learning to distinguish between new sounds, and L2 learner is creating a **new manner based on the L2**

- since this grammar is different from both the L1 and the L2 (especially at early levels), it is called an **interlanguage** -- containing features of both L1 and L2.

the use of features from the L1 in the interlanguage is called **transfer**

- **positive transfer**: the correct use of L1 structures in the L2 (due to similarities between languages)
- **negative transfer**: ...incorrect...

###interlanguage phonology
L2 learners who haven't acquired a particular L2 phoneme substitute phonologically similar phonemes from their L1

###interlanguage syllabification
different languages have different rules for syllabification

###interlanguage morphology
functional morphemes are acquired by L2 learners in roughly the same order as L1 learners.

- a function of semantic and formal complexity

L2 speakers also often **omit** functional morphemes such as **articles, plural marker, past tense marker** much like children do during the telegraphic stage

also depends on the L1

- speakers are delayed in learning inflectional affixes if their L1 lacks inflectional affixes

###interlanguage syntax
structures in the L2 that are similar in the L1 are more easily learned. structures that are more dissimilar are acquired later.

###language myth 3
**some languages are harder to learn than other languages**

- all human languages are equally easy for children to acquire.
	- children will acquire whatever language is in their environment.
	- sometimes multiple languages (Korean speaking father, German speaking mother, French speaking nanny)
