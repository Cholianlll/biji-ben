##sociolinguistics
Sociolinguistics investigates:

- The relationship between language and its context of use.
- Those properties of language which require reference to both internal (linguistic) factor and external (social) factors. e.g., Language Variation
- The interplay between language variation, social meaning and the evolution and development of linguistic systems. e.g., Language Change

###Sociolinguistics and Dialects
####Idiolects:
The characteristics of the language of an individual speaker.
####Dialect:
Mutually intelligible forms of a single language that differ, or vary, in systematic ways.
####Regional Dialects:
Often called different "accents".

- arise through gradual changes in the grammar of different **speech communities**.
- differences increase as a function of the amount of communicative isolation between groups.

####Social Dialects
Dialects that are used by particular social groups or in particular social situations.


**Sociolinguists** are constantly concerned with three facts about language:

1. Language's change.
2. Language's vary.
3. Language's transmit more than semantic meaning.

###Language Change
- Languages are in a constant state of flux.
- Language Variation is a prerequisite for Language Change.
	- Language change doesn't happen overnight.
	- To change from form A to form B, there must necessarily be a stage in which both form A and form B are possible options.

- A lot of sociolinguistics involves examining **linguistic changes in progress** because this guarantees variation.
- other sociolinguistic variables are **stable variables**.

##Language Variation

language varies in two ways:

1. **cross-linguistic variation**: different ways of doing the same thing in different languages. e.g., variation in position of the negative marker in Scandinavian languages.
2. **sociolinguistic variation**: different ways of doing the same thing in the same language, which alternate with one another in the speech of individuals. e.g., variation in the future tense and quotative verbs in English.

sociolinguistic variation involves **linguistic variables**: "two or more ways of saying the same thing."

- linguistic variables exist in all domains of language (e.g., phonology, syntax)
- the set of choices among which speakers **alternate** in the expression of a given meaning or function are called **variants.**
- (Variables) are formally notated with parentheses on a analogy to /phonemes/ and [phones]

###Linguistic Variables
Whichever variant is used, **the same thing** is said:

- Phonetic/Phonological/Morphological: same word/meaning, different morpho-phonological form.
- Syntactic: same meaning, different structure.
- Pragmatic: same function, different form.

####facts about sociolinguistic variation
1. variation is pervasive. language is in a constant state of flux. there are dozens **linguistic variables** in every language.
2. variation is systematic. we don't use different variants of a variable randomly. there is a system of rules that underlies the realization of all linguistic variables.

####pervasive variables
- variable (ing) or 'g'-dropping
- deontic modals
- quotative verbs

####what is not a linguistic variable?
**categorical alternations**: there are things in language that vary, but this variation is dependent entirely on the linguistic context in which it is embedded

- e.g., linguistic rules
- **deterministic/categorical** -- the output of a rule is categorical, given a context.

####What is a linguistic variable?
linguistic variables are not **deterministic**!

a variable can be realized as different variants in identical contexts!

####The myth of free variation
before linguists thought too much about this kind of inter-speaker variation, it was often referred to as 'free variation' because it wasn't categorical.

'free' variation in language is a myth.

**The heart of sociolinguistics is to identify the social, stylistic, and linguistic factors that correlate with the realization of sociolinguistic variables.**

####Variationist sociolinguistics
although sociolinguistic variables are not deterministic/categorical, they also are not free or random!

- they are **probablistic**
- there is **order** amid **heterogeneity**
- the realization of a variable is **subject to probabilities**, given a huge array of possible conditioning factors.
	- social
	- stylistic
	- linguistic
- different **variants** are favoured/disfavoured in particular social/stylistic/linguistic contexts.

##social meaning
language conveys more than just the semantic meaning of what's expressed.

when someone speaks, they reveal all kinds of information:

1. personal characteristics
2. sociological factors
3. social characteristics
4. linguistic style

###personal characteristics
language reveals idiosyncratic characteristics of a speaker's voice and speaking ability.

####quality of voice:
nasal, high-pitched, fast/slow tempo, monotone, lisp, studder

####Speaking ability:
fluent or hesitant? articulate or vague? these personal qualities are all associated with culture-driven judgements:

nasally = annoying

monotone = boring

fluent + vague = evasive

articulate + hesitant = pensive

###social factors

- language reveals social structure.
	- forms of address reflect social rank
		- Mr., sir, ma'am, buddy
		- **tu/vous in French**, du/Sie in German
- language reveals traits that we share with the **social cohorts** to which we belong.
	- as we do with fashion, manners, and material possessions, we express our social identity through our speech.
		- social class
		- sex and gender
		- age
		- ethnicity
		- place
		- local social networks and communities of practice

###linguistic styles
language reveals the familiarity of two speakers with one another and the formality of the conversation.

a **sociolinguistic correlate**: formality tends to increase in direct proportion to the number of social differences between the participants.

- conversations between friends who share common experiences = casual
- conversations between strangers of unequal social rank with no common ground = highly formal
- two extremes on a continuum

what do we mean when we talk about formal/casual speech?

an artifact of linguistic cues!

casual: rapid speech, syntactic ellipses, contractions, phonological assimilations/coalescence, **non-standard variants**

formal: stilted syntax, breathy voice, hyper-corrections, **standard variants**

###The sociolinguistic interview

five tasks within the sociolinguistic interview

formal -> casual

high self-monitoring > low self-monitoring

standard -> non-standard

minimal pair list, word list, reading passage, interview style, casual speech

- Minimal Pair List (MP)
	- read a list of words organized into minimal pairs, differing wit respect to some sociolinguistic variable.
- Word List (WL)
	- read a list of words, randomly ordered.
	
people concentrate almost completely on pronunciation, especially when being recorded by a linguist.

even more so with MP because **minimal pairs prescriptively should be different**. people attempt to differentiate.

- reading passage (RP)
	- read a paragraph of connected speech.
	
also highly self-monitored speech but the requirement of reading coherently deflects some focus from pronunciation to the content of the passage.

- interview style
	- an interview asks a range of directed questions to the speaker. the speaker provides answers.

much more focus on content than with the Reading Passage. Some self-monitoring in the framing of answers.

- casual speech
	- unmonitored speech. the data sine qua non in sociolinguistics!
	- taps into vernacular speech.

There is no-fool-proof way to elicit casual, vernacular speech but sociolinguists use a variety of techniques.

- certain questions that elicit excited responses causing speakers to forget their self-consciousness (e.g., danger of death)

##case study (r)

##Canadian English

Canadian English: a **homogenous dialect**

it's been observed that Canadian English is pretty much the same from the Ontario-Quebec border to Vancouver Island.

at least for the urban, middle class.

this homogeneity is the result of the settlement history of Canada.

###Features of Canadian English
####Lexical Features of Canadian English
#####from indigenous languages
- place names: Canada, Toronto, Squamish etc.
- animals: raccoon, beaver, skunk, grizzly, caribou
- kayal, moccasins

#####from French
- prairie, portage, concession (lines), tuque

#####Archaic British terms
- riding, reeve, acclamation, chesterfield

#####Innovations
- poutine, back bacon, Ioonie, toonie, bachelor (apartment), washroom, Hydro, pencil crayon, double-double, Two-Four, twenty-sixer, postal code, expiry date, Grade X, hoser

####Phonological
#####Canadian Raising
#####[Ã¦] over [A]
#####other differences
#####Vowel Mergers
- Barry, berry, bury, and Mary, merry, marry (not all parts of Canada)
- caught-cot

#####The Canadian Vowel Shift

#####Older Phonological features
- [j] after alveolar consonants and before [u]
- voiceless w
- most Canadians under the age 70 have lost these two features.

####Morpho-syntactic
#####similar to General American English
- requires do-support with have:
	- do you have the time? vs. have you the time?
- high rate of have to modal (over must)

#####some differences
i'm done, i'm finished.

####Pragmatic

eh?
