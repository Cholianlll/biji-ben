##language and ethnicity

###linguistic profiling
####the experts referred to in this paper are linguists John Baugh, William Idsardi and Thomas Purnell

in a 1999 paper, they detailed several experiments that showed:

1. a person's ethnicity can be determined by phonetic correlates alone, with some great accuracy.
2. people can do this based on one word, 'hello'.
3. linguistic profiling and housing discrimination based on one's voice exists.

Purnell, Idsardi and Baugh (1999) consider three, broad dialects of American English:

1. African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
2. Chicano English (ChE)
3. Standard American English (SAE)

the first two dialects can be considered **ethnolects**:

**Def** a variety of a language spoken by a minority ethnic group, amid speakers of non-ethnically defined dialect.

**Conclusion so far:**

- Three varieties of English exists and are easily identifiable: AAVE, ChE, SAE
- speakers of these dialects tend to be African American, Hispanic and European respectively.
- if we can recognize the ethnolect, we can usually identify race.

but John Baugh's recordings show that we can't definitively tell someone's ethnicity by the sound of their voice.

Debate: about ten years ago on CNN, John Baugh debated Johnnie Cochran on this point:

- there are ethnic accents
- people can identify them
- what we do with this knowledge is crucial, not the act of identification

##language and identity
###style... so far
last class we saw that sociolinguists have correlated sociolingusitic variables to particular contextual styles

- minimal pair list
- word list
- reading passage
- interview style
- casual speech

**style-shifting**: is when a speaker, in different contexts, does something linguistically different.

- we saw a case of how a linguistic variable, (r), was correlated with contextual styles.
	- as the style becomes a less self-monitored style, the frequency of non-standard variant increases.
- when a linguistic variable is correlated with contextual style and some other social factor, we call that variable a marker.
	- the use of that variable has **social meaning**: speakers avoid the stigmatized variant when they are self-aware.

###style
more recently, **style** in sociolinguistics has been redefined and reinterpreted.

Schiling-Estes observes:

1. speakers **do not shift style** merely, or primarily, **in reaction to elements of the speech situation** but rather are quite active and creative in their use of stylistic resources.
2. speakers are not bound to the external context as they shape their speech, in fact, **they use their speech to shape and re-shape the context, interpersonal relationships and personal identities.**

###Audience Design
####one account of style-shifting is called the **Audience Design** model.
- not about self-monitoring alone.
- speakers style-shift **in response to audience members**
	- create closeness with hearer.
	- create distance with hearer.
	- e.g., travel agent becomes more vernacular with a difficult client to seem more concerned and helpful.
	
###Speaker Design
####The Speaker Design model promotes the importance of the initiative dimension of style shifting:

- speakers create, present, and recreate their identity by **actively** style-shifting.
	- patterns of linguistic variation are not just about one's position in society.
	- variables are resources that speakers use to place themselves in society.
- speakers have **agency**: not just passive participants.

###Investigating Style and Identity
**acts of identity Theory (Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1986)**

speakers' linguistic behaviour is motivated by attempts to "resemble as closely as possible the group or groups with which from time to time speakers wish to identify."

the acts of identity theory argues that the extent to which speakers are able to modify their speech is constrained by four things:

1. the extent to which you can identify your model group.
2. the extent to which you have sufficient access to the model group and sufficient ability to work out the rules of their behaviour.
3. your ability to modify your behaviour.
4. the strength of various (possible conflicting) motivations towards one or another model and towards retaining your own sense of a unique identity.

####The extent to which we are able to identify our model group.
####The extent to which you have sufficient access to the model group and sufficient ability to work out the rules of their behaviour.
####Your ability to modify your behaviour.

##languages of Canada
There is a wide diversity of languages that are indigenous to North America.

- 65 government recognized languages and dialects from 11 different languages families.
	- most of these languages are moribund.
	- only **three** are predicted to survive the next 100 years without intervention.

###Algonquian
two of the three viable indigenous languages are Cree and Ojibwe/Anishinaabemowin

- However, several of the dialects of Cree and Ojibwe are **endangered**, including dialects that are not mutually intelligible with other dialects.

###Eskimo-Aleut
Inuktitut, the third viable language, is an Eskimo-Aleut language.

- Official language of Nunavut. (Legislative Assembly of Nunavut uses Inuktitut)

###Na-Dené
The Na-Dené family has the most internal diversity (17 in Canada)

###Siouan-Catawban
###Salish
###Tsimshianic
###Iroquoian
###Wakashan

###Isolates
two languages don't seem to be related to any other languages. we call these **language isolates**

###Contact languages
Canada also has a few **pidgins** and **creoles**

- a pidgin is variety of language that emerges when speakers of different languages come together in a stable contact situation. Pidgins have a mix of features of both langurs and no native speakers.
- a creole is a variety of language that arises when children learn pidgins as their native language.

e.g. Chinook Jargon, Mitchif

###The decline of aboriginal languages
UNESCO's: vulnerable, definitely endangered, severely endangered, critically endangered

###Why languages die
####Economics and urbanization
learning the language of trade has major economic advantages.

social mobility means fewer and fewer people are staying in small communities where local, minority languages are spoken.

###language revitalization efforts
####language nests
spaces for native-speaking elders to live and raise children entirely in an endangered language.

- not schools; just places where only the language is spoken.
- successful for revitalizing Mãori.

####Master-apprentice learning
pairs one young learner with a fluent elder for several hours a week.

- no formal teaching, just talking and communicating in the endangered language.
- many languages of California are using this method.

####Immersion schools learning
just like we have French immersion in Canada, where students are taught entirely in French, this has been implemented for endangered languages in an effort to revitalize.

- highly-successful for Hawai'ian
- children can go from kindergarten to university entirely in Hawai'ian.

####Government intervention
The most successful revitalization efforts come with the full support of government.
