#Lecture 11

##Computer-Mediated Communication
###CMC: any discourse that takes place through two networked computers/digital devices.

####linguists classify different type of CMC by two parameters:

- synchronous vs. asynchronous: is an response expected immediately?
- one-to-one vs. one-to-many: how many participants are involved?

					synchronous		asynchronous
		one-to-one	IM, BBM			email, texting, private messaging
		one-to-many	chatroom		blogs, twitter, Facebook comments
	
CMC is a **register**, complete with its own set of norms and conventions

**def:** a 'highly ritualized, routinized variet[y]' of language used in particular situations.

- formal emails
- legal documents
- lecturing

###new linguistic renaissance
####Shall
shall is a modal auxiliary that is part of the future temporal reference system of English

- it is used to express the future tense along with other words like **will** and **be going to**

####say
say is a verb of quotation.

- it is used to introduce reported speech along with other verbs like **go** and **be like**.

####must
must is a deontic modal.

- it is used to expression obligation and necessity along with other elements like **have to** and **gotta**.

####very
very is an adverb of intensification

- it is used next to an adjective to increase the degree of what the adjective is expressing just like **really** and **so**

####So what?
there are four **sociolinguistic variables**.

- a set of different ways to say the same thing
- different variants of a sociolinguistic variable have different social correlations and social meanings
- a variant could be used:
	- by more women than men;
	- by working class people and not middle class people;
	- when speaking to your boss and not when speaking to your friend.

####so why those words?

1. Shall: oldest variant of the **Future Temporal Reference** variable system, and is nearly extinct in speech.
2. Say: the standard variant of **Quotative** variable system.
3. Must: oldest and most formal variant of the **Deontic Modality** variable system.
4. Very: oldest and most formal variant of the **Intensifier** variable system.

####interim summary
1. less non-standard forms; more formal forms in CMC.
2. existence of some highly formal forms in CMC

even a prescriptivist must admit that this is not the 'linguistic ruin of a generation'!

###Features of CMC
####Humphrys and other critics are missing three crucial points:
1. speech communities and registers have a unique set of **shared conventions** with respect to language.
2. abbreviations and acronyms have been part of English for a very long time.
3. abbreviations and acronyms aren't actually very frequent in CMC!

####innovative spelling and capitalization

####Abbrvs
- abbreviations are only a minor part of the register of CMC.
- by and large, abbreviations are a **stylistic resource** -- there are you people and u people; I people and i people -- no robust variation between speakers. no capitalization chaos.

CMC is a fantastic venue for investigating the stylistic use of language -- you must present your identity entirely though written language.

###CMC is short
In sum:

- CMC is a registrer unto itself.
	- has elements of speech and writing.
- teenagers exhibit robust variation in CMC including highly formal variants that aren't found in the speech of people their age.
- abbreviations are a normal part of language and CMC has its own set of conventions.
	- users of CMC know these conventions and use them accurately to communication

####what language is
- core properties of language/grammar
- prescriptive vs. descriptive
- standard vs. non-standard

####The domains of language
- phonetics
- phonology
- morphology
- syntax
- semantics/pragmatics

####Key topics
- L1 acquisition
- L2 acquisition
- History of english
- historical linguistics
- sociolinguistics
- language and ethnicity
- language and identity
- languages death and revitalization
- languages and the internet

###Domains of language
####phonetics
- the IPA and the sounds of English
- anatomy and physiology of speech
- articulatory properties of sounds
- acoustic properties of sound

####Phonology
- phonotactics and syllable structures
- prosody
- phonemes and phonemic/phonetic transcription
- allophonic variation and rules
- natural classes and distinctive features

####morphology
- types of morphemes
- word formation and structural ambiguity
- morphology in other languages
- morphological alternations

####Syntax
- grammatical categories
- generative rules and the infinity of syntax
- hierarchical structures and phrases
- syntactic trees and ambiguity

####semantics
- semantic ambiguity
- different approaches to meaning
- how to combine a noun and a verb to have a sentential meaning
- connections to logical connectors and quantifiers

####Pragmatics
- context shapes utterances
- utterances shape context
- aspects of a conversation
- conversational implicatures

###Key topics 
####first language acquisition
- innateness
- stages of phonological acquisition
- babies as great phoneticians
- phonological strategies
- morphological acquisition
- stages of syntactic acquisition

####history of English
- historical background (who conquered who)
- various influences on english
- grammatical features of old, middle, early modern english

####historical linguistics
- genetic relations between languages 
- language families of the word (esp. Ido-European)
- reasons languages seem similar
- reconstruction and identifying changes

####sociolinguistics
- language variation and sociolinguistic variables
- language change
- languages transmit more than semantic meaning:
	- personal traits, sociological information, **linguistic style**, and **social features**
- the sociolinguistic interview and style shifting
- hypercorrection

####Canadian English
- history of Canadian English
- homogeneity
- lexical, phonological, morpho-syntactic features of CanEng.
- eh!

####language and ethnicity
- ethnolects
- linguistic profiling

language and identity
- we use sociolinguistic variables to express our personal identities
- audience design vs. speaker design
- acts of identity theory.

####languages of Canada, death, and revitalization
- the languages and language families of Canada
- viability of languages in Canada
- reasons for the decline of aboriginal languages (E.g., residential schools system)
- why save languages
- ways to save languages
