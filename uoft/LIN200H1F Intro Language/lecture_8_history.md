#Lecture 8 History
##Historical Linguistics
- The study of **language change** and the **relatedness** of languages.
- "linguistics archeologists"
	- make discovers not just about language but also human history
	
question:

how do languages change and diversify over time?

how are languages "genetically" related?

- some facts:
	- all languages are in **a constant state of flux**.
		- we don't speak the same way our parents do and our parents don't speak the way as our grandparents, even if we all speak the same language.
	- some languages are similar to each other.
		- keep the **language/dialect** distinction in mind!
		
##History of English
###Origins of English
West Germanic speaking tribes (Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Frisians) moved into England, and this invasion marks the beginning of the **Old English** period.

- from 449 onward, the language of these tribes is separate from the Germanic languages spoken on mainland Europe.
- also referred to as **Anglo-Saxon**
- the invading tribes formed seven kingdoms in England.
	- Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia (Angles)
	- Essex, Sussex, Wessex (Saxons)
	- Kent (Juets)
- formed the old English Dialects.
	
###More Invasions
9th century, Danes and Vikings invaded and settled in Northern and Eastern England.

- Danelaw

The invaders spoke **Old Norse**.

- Germanic parent language of Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, and Faroese.
- Many Norse words were borrowed into English at this time.
	- egg, kid, get, give, skill, skin, sky, they, them, their etc.
- some doublets in English:
	- shirt~skirt
	- shy~scare

###Influence of Latin on Old English
- Old English borrowed extensively from **Latin**.
	- Many  borrowings into the (proto-English) West Germanic disaffects prior to the Anglo-Saxon invasion.
		- wine from Latin vīnum
	- Under the influence of the Catholic Church, many more words were borrowed.
		- England was Christianized throughout the 7th century.
- English has continuously borrowed words from Latin.
	- Today, more than 25% of English vocabulary is from Latin.
	- Most of the borrowings happened during the Old English period.

###Old English Grammar
- Old English has a number of grammatical distinctions and structures that have since been lost in English:
	- Case distinctions and grammatical gender.
	- Distinct 2nd person singular and plural pronouns.
	- Singular, Plural, and **Dual** Pronouns.
	- Strong/weak verb paradigms.
	- Variable word order.
	
- Grammatical Case
	- Nouns also had **grammatical gender**, like French, Spanish, Icelandic, German.

- Many of these pronouns survived into Modern or Early Modern English.

- Other changes:
	- lost the **dual** pronouns
	- 3rd pl. pronouns replaced with Old Norse variants
	- Eventually 2nd sg. pronouns replaced with 2nd pl. pronouns
	
- Weak/Strong Verbs
- There were two types of verbs: **weak** and **strong**
	- weak verbs used suffixes (like -ed) to mark theses distinctions
	- strong verbs used a process of vowel change called **ablaut** to indicate past tense and past participle forms.
		- vestiges of the system remain in Modern English irregular verbs.

- Variable Word Order
- Old English has much more free word order than Modern English because **case** indicated subject, object, etc.

###Middle English (More Invading)

- The Norman Conquest of English (1066)	
	- Normans adopted French, brought it with them.
	- Norman French becomes the language of the upper class and the language of government, law, and literature.
	- English remained the language "of the people".

###Middle English Borrowings

- During this period, English **borrowed** many words from French.
	- Mostly related to **government and law**:
		- accuse, acquit, administer, advocate, attorney, bail, baron, constable, convict, council, court, crown, duke, estate, evidence, fine, govern, heir, jury, liberty, madam, manor, major, noble, oppress, parliament, peasant, plea, pledge, prison, reign, royal, sentence, subject, tax...
	- Some more general usage:
		- bacon, blue, dinner, music, sugar, beef, brown, cream herb, mustard, pork, supper, biscuit, button, lamp, salad, chair, dance, paper...

- Native English words continued to be used for farm animals (by the English speaking farmers), yet the name for the meat of those animals was borrowed from French:
	- beef, pork, mutton, poultry
	
###Decline of French Influence

- After the conquest of Normandy by the French in 1204, there was a rising sense of English nationalism in the Middle English period.
	- the influence and prestige of Norman French greatly subsides thereafter.
	- throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, still a lot of borrowings from **Latin** (the language of learned Europe).
	
- Other changes...
	- Loss of inflectional endings for case, number and gender.
		- case becomes restricted to pronouns (like Mod. English)
		- English shifts away from **grammatical gender** to a system of **natural gender**.
	- Loss of case inflection led to fixed SVO **word order**.
	- Increase in modal verbs.

###Early Modern English
The start of the **Early Modern English** period is marked by William Caxton's introduction of the printing press to England in 1476 and the English Renaissance.

- Led to an increase in literacy.
- Led to a standardization of English (based on London dialect), complete with dictionaries and prescriptive writing manuals.

###Early Modern English Borrowings

- a lot of technical terminology was borrowed from Greek and Latin during this period.
- Italian words from art, music, architecture, and poetry were borrowed into English.
	- Art: fresco, miniature, profile, relief
	- Architecture: rotunda, stucco
	- Music: oratorio, trill
	- Poetry: sonnet, stanza
- Vocabulary explosion from many languages:
	- German, Celtic, Russian, Norwegian, Dutch, Ojibwe, Cree, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, Igbo, Cantonese

###Early Modern English Grammar

- Auxiliary 'do' appeared:
	- i doubt it not -> i do not doubt it.
- Plural -s suffix replaced most other plural forms, with a few exceptions.
	- en: ox/oxen, child/children, brother/brethren
	- vowel change: mouse/mice, foot/feet
- 3rd person singular agreement ending changes from -eth to -s.
	- cometh and goeth -> come and goes
- word final schwas dropped.
	- left English orthography with a lot of silent 'e's (e.g. some, give).
- start of r-dropping in some dialects.

- fun fact: Shakespearean actors would not have dropped their rs yet... a later development.

###Early Modern English: The Great Vowel Shift

A major development in the phonology of Early Modern English was a systematic vowel shift that affected **the long vowels**

One of the major reasons the English writing system is so wild.

The two high vowels become diphthongs while the other vowels are pulled higher to fill the space left by the high vowels.

**A chain shift**

##Language Families
###Relatedness of languages
**DEF**: words of different languages that have descended from a common source.

###Genetic Relationships between languages
languages that share features in common are often descended from the same language.

All the languages that William Jones discussed descended from a common language, **Proto-Indo-European**.

Proto-Indo-European split and diversified many times over:

- Proto-Balto-Slavic
	- Russian, Polish, Bulgarian etc.
- Proto-Germanic
	- Icelandic, German, English etc.
- Proto-Italo-Celtic
	- Fench, Romanian, Irish etc.
- Proto-Indo-Iranian
	- Persian, Pashto, Hindi-Urdu etc.
- Plus Greek, Albanian, Armenian, and a few extinct languages.

A **proto-language** is an ancestral language from which related languages have developed.

- No written form but linguists have **reconstructed** proto-languages from **sound correspondences** across related languages.
- PIE has been reconstructed based on descendent languages.

Who were the Proto-Indo-Europeans?

- must have emerged within the last 10000 years
	- IE languages have cognates for agricultural terms
- lived in a northern climate.
	- IE languages have cognates for northern flora and fauna, but not southern flora and fauna.

###Other language families: Niger-Congo, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic

###Language families of north america

- major language families of Canada
	- **Algic**:
	- **Salish**:
	- **Iroquian**:
	- **Wakashan**:
	- **Tsimshianic**:
	- **Na-Dené**:
	- **Inuit**:

there's a controversial theory that all the non-Inuit, non-Na-Dené languages are part of one family called Amerind, but most linguists don't believe this.

- other families
	- Trans-New-Guinea
	- Dravidian
	- Pama-Nyungan
	- Turkifc
	- Mongolic
	- Japonic
	- Caucasian
	- Khoi
	- Tai-Kadai
	- Uralic
	- ...
	
- Language isolates
	- **Basque** (the last of the pre-Indo-European languages?)
	- Korean
	- Haida
	- Ainu

###Relatedness and Unrelatedness

- There are other reasons languages can have similar features.
	- Universal tendencies
		- e.g., all languages have syllables, certain word orders are rare.
	- Diffusion/Sprachbunds
		- Languages constant borrow from other languages, even unrelated language (diffusion of features)
		- Unrelated languages that are in close proximate often share features
		- **Sprachbunds** (Ger. language leagues) are groups of unrelated languages that share many features:
			- e.g., three language families of the Pacific Northwest share: ejectives, location/shape affixes, verb initial word order.
	- Accident
		- Bantu and Algic have causative morphemes but couldn't possibly be related.
		- English *mama*, Hebrew *ima*, Madarian *mā*

##Reconstruction
###Reconstructing earlier languages
How do we know language are related?

- examine **cognates**
	- establish sound correspondences
- look for other correspondences:
	- similar syntactic structures
	- similar morphology

finding cognates...

- we already saw some cognates in Indo-European.
- Which words should we compare?
	- some words are more **stable** (less likely to be replaced through borrowing/innovation).
	- kinship terms
		- mother, father, sister, aunt
	- pronouns
		- I, you, he, she, they
	- numerals, body parts, animals, agriculture, natural features, mental/bodily functions, verbs of construction and motion...
- **Swadesh List**: 200 generally stable meanings, used for consistent comparison across languages.

Establishing sound correspondences:

If we compare a set of cognates from two languages and we see that one sound appears in one language exactly where a different sound appears in another language, we call this a **sound correspondence**

Putting it all together. how do we reconstruct an ancestral language?

- Majority rules: assume that the more frequent forms/sounds in the daughter languages were the form in the proto-language.
- phonological naturalness: some changes are more common cross-linguistically

natural changes

	assimilation, frication, affrication, intervocalic voicing, deletion (esp. finally), degemination (tt->t), debuccalization (C->h)
	
less frequent changes

	dissimilation, stopping, deaffrication, devoicing, consonant epenthesis, gemination, deglottalization (h->C)
	
**Very Important!!!**: **Phonological naturalness** can outweigh **majority rules**

###Grimm's Law: A sound change from PIE to Germanic
Jacob Grimm (of the Brother's Grimm) discovered a major, systematic, **regular** sound change that happened between PIE and Germanic

- Regular sound changes effect every word with the affected phoneme in it.

###How far back can we go?

Not that far!

- Some historical linguists have attempted to trace connections between languages families.
- It's surely possible that some broad language families are connected to each other but...

1. the rate of linguistic change is great enough that after a few thousand years of spa ration, two genetically related languages may show only the faintest traces of common origin.
2. thus, the reconstruction method can only be used to trace common ancestry at most a few thousand years in the past.
3. written records extend our perspective but the oldest written records are only 5000 years old and for only a few languages do we have texts that go back 2000 years.
4. thus, even with written records, the best we can do is trace genetic relationships 6000-8000 years into the past but in most cases no more than 3000 or 4000 years.
