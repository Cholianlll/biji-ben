Python: 
    - a statement is a program
Java: 
    - a statement is not a program
    - need a class
    - need a main method

Python: 
    - values have types
    - variables do not have types, they are just names
Java:  
    - variables have types

Python: 
    - fully object-oriented
    - 3 is an object, it has methods, etc.
Java: 
    - primitive types: int, double, boolean, char, etc.
      (e.g., 3 is a primitive type)
    - objects (these have methods, etc.)
    - wrapper classes for primitive types (e.g. Integer for int)
