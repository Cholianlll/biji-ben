flightpool:

flight1 A-B
flight2 A-C
flight3 B-C
flight4 A-D
flight5 B-D
flight6 A-D

suppose these are all on the same day, and no conflicts for departure and arrival time.

allCities(flightpool)

cities = empty list

for each flight in flightpool, add origin and destination to cities if not appeared before.

NOW we want to createItinerary from A to D using combination.

allRoutes(A, D, {cities except A and D}) which are

A-D
A-B-D
A-C-D
A-B-C-D
A-C-B-D

now searchFlights2 for each itineary, if all flights in an itinerary is ok, then the whole itinerary is ok.


about searchFlight2, it takes the origin and destination, return the flight(s)


for each two continuous flights in "temporary itinerary" check if time conflicts:
	- arrival of first < departure of second
	- stop time < hours
