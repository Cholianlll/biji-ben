## 1.Nature of Light
**the fundamental forces:**

**strong interaction**: holds uncleons together in the nucleus

**weak interaction**: mediates nuclear reactions such as fission and beta decay

**electromagnetic force** and **gravity**: both of these are long-range comparatively. Electromagnetic force - everyday experience; holds ions, molecules together. Gravity is the most important in the universe as a whole, over scales larger than 10^-6 cm, gravity dominates. It shapes the universe.

**entropy**: a measure of the disorder.

**First Law of Thermodynamics**: The conservation of energy.

**Second Law of Thermodynamics**: in any process, the overall entropy increases, or at best remains the same.

**Third Law of Thermodynamics**: absolute zero can never be attained, but only approached arbitrarily closely.

-----

**Doppler effect**: a consequence of the relative motion between the source and the observer.

**blueshift**: light waves bunch up and are shifted toward higher frequencies.

**redshift**: conversely.

**formula for the Doppler shift of light** = z = (wavelength in the frame of receiver - wavelength in the frame of emiiter)/ wavelengh in the frame of emitter = v/c

---
**Newton**: White light was a combination of all colors.

**Einstein**: Light -> particle or wave?

**electromagnetic spectrum**:progressing to higher frequencies -> microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma radiation.

**light speed**: 2.998*10^8 m/s

**light year**: 9.5*10^12 km

**blackbody**: a perfect absorber, its thermal emission is predictable. By definition, a perfect absorber is also a perfect emitter. Radiation from such an object is called **blackbody radiation**.

**Wien Displacement Law**: aproximately, the peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum = 0.29/T cm (is inversely related to temperature)

**one property of blackbody radiation**: the shape of the spectrum is always the same; simply shifted to shorter wavelengths at higher temperature.

**another property of blackbody radiation**: the quantity of energy radiated per unit surface area goes up as the forth power of the temperature. E is proportional to T^4. Stars are approximately blackbodies, so a hot star with a surface temperature twice that of the Sun would be radiating 16 times as much energy per unit surface area.

**Einstein (1905)**: light acts not only like a wave, but sometimes like a particle; the photon is the quantum of light. Each photon carries an amount of energy given by the formula E = hv, where h is a constant called Planck's constant, and v is the frequency of the corresponding wave. A single photon carries one quantum of energy; hence it is associated only with a single wavelength and frequency, that is, a mnochromatic wave.

---

**luminosity**: the total amount of electromagnetic energy emitted per unit time (the power) by a source is called the luminosity, generally symbolized as ***L***.

**brightness = L/4πR^2**: brightness is also called energy flux, it specifies the power per unit area.

**mass of the Sun** = 2*10^30 kg, also called solar mass.

## 2.Nature of Space and Time

**the anthropic principle**: its mostbasic form, the *the weak antrhopic principle*, states that the conditions we observe in the universe must be compatible with our own existence. A more stringent, and controversial, form of the antrhopic principle, the *strong anthropic principle*, states that the initial conditions occurred because we are here; that is, our presence here and now somehow affected the initial conditions such that we could eventually arise.

###The cosmological principle

**The geocentric universe of Aristotle**

**The Copernican principle**: The Earth or the solar system does not occupy any special place in the universe. But does not claim that no center exists; only that we are not located there.

Here we need **two important concepts**: *isotropy* and *homogeneity*.

**isotropy**: the property of uniformity in all directions. No single direction is special or distinct from any other.

**homogeneity**: the property of similarity of all locations.

It is possible for a universe to be isotropic but not homogeneous; however, this occurs only in the special, and rather contrived, case that some central point exists, and isotropy holds only at that single point. e.g. of an istropic, but inhomogeneous, situation would be the pinnacle of the only hill in a huge forest. From this point the scenery would look the same in every direction. But the observed istropy holds only at the peak of the hill. Away from the peak there would always be a special direction: upward to the summit of the hill. Hence if the universe seems to be isotropic, that is, the same in all directions, then either it really is the same everywhere, or else we live at a unique point where the universe gives the appearance of isotropy. Therefore, despite our inability to examine all of space, we can infer that the universe is probably homogeneous by noting that it appears to be isotropic on the largest scales. If we apply the *Copernican principle* to state that we are not at a special location, then the universe must look more or less isotropoic to *all* observers and must, therefore, be homogeneous. **Isotropy plus the Copernican principle implies homogeneity.**

NOTE: the surface of a uniform cylinder is homogeneous but not isotropic.

**cosmological principle**: The universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. The same physical laws apply throughout the universe.

**perfect cosmological principle**: the universe is the same at every point in space and at every point in *time*.

Modern big bang cosomology is built on the foundation of general relativity and the cosmological principle.

###The General Theory of Relativity

**Newtonian (or weak) equivalence principle**: gravity is completely indistinguishable from (or equivalent to) any other acceleration.

**Einstein (or strong) equivalence principle**: *all* inertial and freely falling frames are completely equivalent, and there is no experiment that can distinguish them.

The Einstein equivalence principle asserts that all laws of physics are identical in any inertial frame, including the laws governing the behaviour of light. The loss of energy experienced by a light wave as it climbs out of a gravitational field is called the **gravitational redshift**. Simply, light is affected by gravity.

**Gravitational time dilation and length contraction**: Time dialation from the equivalence principle. From special relativity, we know that the moving clock on the centrifuge will run slower than the clock at rest. The clock on the centrifuge is not in an inertial frame but is experiencing a centrifugal force. We conclude that inertial force make clocks run slow. Gravity is equivalent to acceleration by the equivalence principle; hence a clock undergoing gravitational acceleration will run slow compared to an unaccelerated clock.

## 3.Dark Matter
Milky Way Galaxy and Andromeda Galaxy (both of them are spiral) dominate the *Local Group (a **galaxy cluster**)*, and they have several smaller satellite galaxies, which orbit their primary like moons orbit a plane. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, visible only from the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth, are two of the larger satellites of the Milky way.

The Local Group and several other small clusters are satellites of the **Virgo Cluster**. A cluster of galaxy clusters is called a **supercluster**. Then looking out of Virgo Cluster, the supercluster consisting of the Virgo Cluster and its satellites, including the Local Group, is called the Local Supercluster.

**development**: 

**top-down structure formation**: superclusters form first, then gragment into clusters, which in turn shattered into individual galaxies.

**bottom-up structure formation**: galaxies are the fundamental building blocks; galaxies form, then become drawn into clusters by mutual gravitational attraction, follewed by the evolution of superclusters as the clusters are themeselves pulled together.

###The emergence of galaxies

By detecting CMR, WMAP found the first stars arrived on the scene at a remarkably high redshift of around z = 17 +/- 4, corresponding to a time only approximately **200 million years after the big bang**.

Quasars, z = 3.4 or greater.

### The matter content of the universe

**some evidence of the existence of dark matter**: the roation speeds of spiral galaxies (by Kepler's Third Law)…

**Neutrinos are an example of hot dakr matter.** "hot" refers to the speed of the neutrinos as they move through the universe; massive neutrino still travel at speeds close to that of light.

**dark matter**: any gravitating mass that does not produce light. Also often used in a more restrictive sense to refer to nonbaryonic gravitating mass, as in hot dark matter or cold dark matter.

**MACHO**: Massive Compact Halo Object. Any object such as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole that could account for some of the dark matter in the halos of galaxies.

**neutrino**: any of three species of very weakly interacting lepton with an extremely small mass.

**hot dark matter**: A type of nonbaryonic particle that has a velocity close to the speed of light at the time it decouples from other matter in the early universe. A predominance of hot dark matter would produce mainly large-scale structure, leading to top-down structure formation.

**WIMP**: Weakly Interacting Massive Particle. A particle with a nonzero mass that participates only in the weak interaction.

**cold dark matter**: a type of nonbaryonic particle whose energy is low at the time it decouples from other matter, and whose mass plays a key role in cosmic structure formation. Cold dark matter leads to bottom-up structure formation.

## 4.Expansion and Dark Energy

**method of parallax**: d = 2AU/2p = AU/p

AU = distance of the earth from the Sun, p = measured parallax angle, d = desired distance to the star.

p must be expressed in radians. However, p is usually measured in second of arc, 1/3600th of a degree. we call this distance producing one second of arc of parallax over the baseline of the Earth's orbit, **parsec**.

**1 parsec = 3.26 lightyears**

The most common indirect appraoch is the **method of luminosity distance**. depends upon the fact that if the intinsic luminosity of an object is known:

d = square root of (L/4πb)

where L is the star's luminosity, its total output of energy per unit time; b is the  apparent brightness obtained from the light falling upon the telescope.

The Sun has an intrinsic luminosity of L = 4*10^26 watts.

**major weakness of the method of luminosity distance**: its reliance upon a knowledge of the absolute luminosity of the target object. Once the luminosity of a particular type of star is known, it becomes a **standard candle**, a term referring to any object of known luminosity. As it turns out, stars of a given mass and age vary little in luminosity; if we find another star of the same type that is too far away for its parallax to be measured, we can, in principle, obtain its luminosity distance. **Unfortunately**, a further set of difficulties complicates this type of measurement. One particularly important confounding effect is the presence of intervening dust, which reduces the apparent brightness of a standard candle beyond that explained by distance alone. This phenomenon is known as **extinction**.

### The Hubble law

**Hubble's classification scheme for galaxies**: spiral or elliptical.

**Spiral galaxies**: disk-like, central bulge, with spiral arms of greater or lesser prominence.

**Elliptical galaxies**: ellipsoidal conglomerations of stars.

**The Hubble Law**: redshift is proportional to distance, namely z is proportional to l. Doppler redshift behave the same way with z <= 0.1.

**v = HL**
**H is called the Hubble constant, which is the slope.** **now, H = 72 km/s/Mpc**

The **Hubble time** is an estimate of the age of the universe (which is an expanding universe, the ). t(H) = 1/H = 2*10^10 years for H = 50

The **Hubble length** is an estimate of the size of the observable universe, the distance that light could travel in one Hubble time, D(H) = ct(H) = c/H = 20 billion lightyears for H = 50

**dark energy**: Energy associated with the vaccum of space that drives acceleration in the overall expansion of the universe.

**Hubble expansion**: the separation of galaxies due only to the expansion of space.

### Modeling the universe

**Newtonian universe**: A sphere of radius R contains uniformly distributed dust. A test particle with mass m, located at the edge of the sphere, feels the gravitational attraction of all this mass directed toward the center of the sphere. The whole system is expanding due to some initial outward velocity, but gravity causes that expansion to decelerate.

**Friedmann equation**: an equation describing the evolution of the cosmological scale factor of the Robertson-Walker metric.

**standard model**: one of the set of big bang cosmological models that are generated with the minimum set of assumptions, namely that the cosmological principle holds and the cosmological constant is zero.

**big bang**: the state of extremely high (classically, infinite) density and temperature from which the universe began expanding.

**big crunch**: the state of extremely high density and temperature into which a closed universe will recollapse in the distant future.

**matter density parameter**: the ratio of the average density in gravitating matter to the critical density, written omega(M)

**critical density**: that density which just stops the expansion of space, after infinite cosmic time has elapsed. in the standard models, the critical density requires that the spatial geometry be flat.

**closed universe**: a standard model with a spherical three-dim spatial geometry. such a universe is finite in both space and time and recollpases.

**flat universe**: a model whose 3d spatial geometry is flat.

**open universe**: a model that expands forever and is infinite in space and time, although it begins with a big bang. sometimes applied strictly to the hyperbolic standard model, although both the hyperbolic and flat models are open in teh sense of expanding forever.

---
**dark energy**: the term given to teh energy taht is responsible for the overall acceleration of the universe. Possible dark energies include a cosmological constant A, a nonzero vacuum energy, or otherwise unknown forms of energy dubbed quintessence.

## 5.Big Bang

**nucleosynthesis**: the process by which nuclear reactions produce the various elements of the Periodic Table.

**thermal equilibrium**: a state in which energy is equally distributed among all particles, and all the statistical properties of the particles can be described by a single parameter, the temperature.

**matter era**: the epoch of the universe, lasting from approximately the time of recombination until the present, during which the energy density of radiation is negligible in determing the overall gravitational field of the universe, and the mass-energy density of matter dominant.

**radiation era**: the epoch in the history of the universe, lasting from the big bang until approximately the time of recombination, during which the energy density of radiation controlled the gravity of the cosmos.

**graviton**: a hypothetical massless boson that is the carrier of the gravitational force.

**Planck epoch**: the epoch from the beginning of the universe until the Planck time. Very little is known about this interval, although probably all four fundamental forces were united.

**unifed epoch**: that interval in the early history of the universe when three of the four fundamental forces, the strong and weak interactions and the electromagnetic force, were unified.

**inflation**: a period of exponential increase in the scale factor, due to a nonzero vacuum energy density, that occurs early in the history of the universe in certain cosmological models.

**hadron**: a class of particles which participate in the strong interaction. hadrons consist of those particles (baryons, mesons) which are composed of quarks.

**lepton**: a member of a class of fermionic particles that do not participate in the strong interaction. The best-known lepton is the electron.

**quark**: one of the six fundamental particles that make up hadrons.

**baryon**: a fermionic particle consisting of three quarks. the most important baryons are the proton and the neutron.

**quark epoch**: the interval in the early universe during which quarks were unconfined in hadrons and were dominant.

**gluon**: a hypothetical particle that binds quarks together into hadrons.

**electroweak interaction**: the unified electromagnetic and weak forces. also called the electroweak force.

**hadron epoch**: that interval in the early history of the univesre after the quarks had condensed into hadrons, and before the temperature dropped below the threshold temperature for protons.

**lepton epoch**: the interval in the early history of the universe during which leptons dominated.

**recombination**: the moment in the early universe when the temperature became sufficiently low that free electrons could no longer overcome the electrostatic attraction of the hydrogen nuclei and were captured to form atomic hydrogen. when this occurred the universe became transparent.

**Olbers' paradox**: the fact that the night sky is dark even though in an infinite universe with stars that live forever, the night sky would be as bright as the surface of a star. the paradox disappears when it is realized that stars do not live forever and the universe is not infinitely old.

**cosmic background radiation (CBR)**: the blackbody radiation, now mostly in the microwave band, which consists of relic photons left over from the very hot, early phase of the big bang.

**surface of last scattering**: the point at recombination at which the CBR photons last interacted with the baryonic matter. After this, the CBR photons streamed freely through space. the surface of last scattering is what is seen when the CBR is observed.

---

## 6.Inflation

**horizon**: any surface that demarcates events that can be seen from those that cannot be seen.

**event horizon**: a lightlike surface that divides space-time into two regions; that which can be observed, and that which cannot. the Schwarzchild radius of a nonrotating black hole is an event horizon.

**particle horizon**: a surface beyond which we cannot see because the light from farther objects has not had time to reach us over the age of the universe.

**horizon problem**: the conflict between the observed high uniformity of the cosmic background radiation and the fact that regions of the sky separated by an angular size of more than approximatley one degree could not have been in causal contact at the time of recombination.

**flatness problem**: the observed fact that the geometry of the universe is very nearly flat, which is a very special condition, with no explanation of why it should be flat.

**structure problem**: the difficulty of explaining the origin of structure, representing local inhomogeneities, in a universe that is isotropic and homogeneous on the largest scales.

**relic problem**: the problem in standard cosmology in which variosu theories of particles physics would invariably produce massive particles that are not observed.

## 7.Origin of complexity: Galaxies

## 8.Origin of complexity: Stars and Planets

A star's luminosity increases as the third power of its mass. Since a star's lifetime will be affected mainly by its mass divided by its luminosity, it follows that the more massive stars die earlier.

**interstellar medium**: gas, dust, bits of ice, etc. that fill the space between the stars. nearly all of the interstellar medium is hydrogen and helium gas, with hydrogen most abundant.

**nebula**: a cloud of gas in space.

**brown dwarf**: a substellar object that is near, but below the minimum mass for nuclear fusion reactions to occur in its core.

**hydrostatic equilibrium**: the balance between gravity and gas pressure in an object such as a star.

**ideal gas**: a gas in which the mutual interactions of the gas particles are negligible, except for their momentary collisions. the pressure is determined by the ideal gas law, which is the formula that relates temperature, pressure, and volume for an ideal gas.

**deuterium**: an isotope of hydrogen whose nucleus contains on proton and one neutron.

**main sequence**: the curve on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram along which stable hydrongen-fusing stars lie.

**Population I, II, III**: lables for the generations of stars, determined by the proportion of heavy elements contained in their members. Population I stars are youngest, while Population III represents the primordial stars.

**globular cluster**: an aggregation of approximately 100,000 stars. Halos of globular clusters orbit many galaxies. some globular clusters are thought to be among the oldest structures in universe.

**turnoff mass**: the mass of the largest star in a cluster that is still on the main sequence to the red giant phase depends almost entirely upon its mass and chemical composition, with more massive stars leaving the main sequence earlier. the stars in a cluster all formed at essentially the same time and have similar chemical composition, so the turnoff mass can be used to determine the age of the cluster.

**red giant**: a star near the end of its life; it fuses heavier elements in its core and has a greatly expanded outer layer.

**electron degeneracy**: a condition of matter in which all quantum states available to the electrons are filled.

**white dwarf**: a compact stellar remnant supported by electron degeneracy pressure and shining only by the diffusion of light from its interior. white dwarfs cool slowly: if the universe exists long enough they will all cool into nonluminous black dwarfs.
