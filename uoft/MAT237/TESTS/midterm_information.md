#Midterm Information
This space will be used to provide updates to information on the Midterm and will likely be expanded over the next week. 

**COVERAGE:** The Midterm is roughly on all that we covered in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 (up to and including 2.10, we also covered 1.8 that wasn't on the first test). You can see the document "Coverage" in the Syllabus for exceptions (*note that 2.10 only appears in the comments to that list*). Additionally see the "proofs" section coming up. You may find it useful to *read the Quiz2/3/4 info sheets* that break down some of the material we have covered in more detail (listing, for instance, some good exercises to do). 

**RATIO:** The Midterm is tilted slightly towards the 2nd half than the 1st half. Last year it was 3 of 8 questions on the first half. The ratio will be something similar this year. 

**FORMAT:** As with Test 1 there will be a mixture of statements of definitions and reproductions of proofs, as well as various applications. The applications (unlike Chapter 1 material) may also be "compute" questions like computing Talyor polynomials or critical points, and not just proving new things as it was for Chapter 1. 

**PROOFS:** See the document on proofs for the midterm. You should be able to reproduce everything on this list. You can also read the changes from test 1's list, and my suggestion on how to go about studying for these.
