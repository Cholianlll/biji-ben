#CSC318 Notes
Design of Interactive Computational Media

##Week 1 Lecture 1

###What is CSC318?

**Design of** Investigation, development and evaluation

**Interactive** Involves human users

**Computational** Involves a computer

**Media** The interface that facilitates the interaction

###Human-Computer Interface
- The place where humans and computers meet
- The human's image(view) of the computer
- Allows interaction with the computer
- Should be **invisible**, allowing user to focus on the task

###Past and Future in Human-Computer Interaction
- Bill Buxton
- Moore's Law:
	- The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (and therefore its computing power) doubles every two years.
- Curve of Innovation
	- It takes approximately 20 years for a new idea to go from the prototype phase to achieving widespread penetration.
	- The biggest thing in 10 years is already 10 years old.
	- Understanding the history of HCI and its failed attempts is as important as thinking ahead.
	
###Critical Thinking and User Needs

##Week 1 Lecture 2

###Human-Computer Interaction

####1980's

> HCI is the set of **processes, diaogues** and **actions** through which a **human** user employs and **interacts** with a **computer**. (Baecker & Buxton, 1987)

The initial focus in HCI was on the properties of various I/O devices, on improving their accuracy and on understanding the user's raw cognitive capabilities with respect to learning how to use them.

####1990's

> HCI is a discipline concerned with the **design, evaluation** and **implementation** of interacting computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them. (ACM SIGCHI 1994)

This definition implies a sequence of steps in which evaluation of user interface comes before its implementation. It also hints at the need to understand users in a more significant way.

####2000s

> An interdisciplinary field focused on the **interactions** between human users and computer systems, including the user interface [that seeks to] create **effective, efficient, and satisfying interactions.** (McGraw-Hill Consie Encyclopedia of Engineering 2002)

The user's subjective experience matters more and more, as interactive systems pervade more and more of our lives.

####some current trends:
- **User customization:** users can customize, remix and reinvent interfaces to suit their needs.
- **Embedded computation:** new computational interfaces are all around us: smart appliances, ambient interactions, and wearables.
- **Augmented reality:** navigation, gameplay, just-in-time information overlaid on our world.

- Design-centered, humans, tasks and technology towards it.

###Interaction Design
- Designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives (SRP 2011)
- The design of spaces for human communication and interaction (Winograd 1997)

This is a highly multidisciplinary process that involves CREATING something new.

###User Experience
- Everything that the user sees, hears and touches.
- The overall experience a user has with a product, service or event.
- How satisfying, usable, and well-designed users perceive an interface to be.

This is the phenomenon you need to UNDERSTAND and STRIVE TO IMPROVE in order to succeed when designing interactions.

##Iteration and Evaluation
The user experience is a crucial driving force in interaction design.

User-Centered Design (UCD) involves testing with users at every stage of the design process.

1. Needs and requirements
2. Develop designs
3. Build prototypes
4. Evaluate designs

##Week 2 Lecture 1 Design Process and User Research
###Challenges
####Challenges in ID
- **Communication** to group members, users, the general public
- **Design** follow a process, create effective and delightful interfaces
- **Research** ascertain user needs and evaluate your designs

####Communication Challenges
Communicating your ideas varies by:

- **Medium** (oral, written, visual, Web-based)
- **Format** (report, pitch, discussion)
- **Tone** (formal, informal)
- **Length**
	- Oral: elevator, golf course, airplane
	- Written: tagline, sentence, paragraph, story
	
####Group Work Tips
- identify contact details and schedules (PI)
- plan and run regular group meetings
- keep meetings brief
- assign participants roles for meeting: scribe, facilitator, timer
- identify clear purpose for each meeting
- record meeting details: follow-ups, responsibilitites, assignments, notes
- damage control & move on

###IDEO Design Process
IDEO is a leading industrial design film. In 1999 they redesigned the shopping cart for ABC's Nightline program.

Some inspirational thoughts:

- The only thing not designed is nature.
- Fail often in order to succeed sooner.
- Stay focused.
- One conversation at a time.
- Encourage wild ideas.
- Defer judgment.
- Enlightened trial and error over lone genius.

###Lifecycle Models
Lifecycle models break down complex design tasks into manageable stages.

In software engineering:

- waterfall, spiral, incremental/iterative, agile

In HCI:

- Star(evaluation at the centre)
- Usability engineering (user feedback after build)
- **User-centered design** (user feedback throughout)
- Participatory design (users are on the design team)

###UCD Methods

|Stage|Methods|
|:-|:-|
|Needs|user profiles, needs, scenarios, task analysis, environment, technology, work practices, business goals, competition, personas|
|Design|conceptual model, proposed scenarios, interaction process, interface, prototype, product|
|Build|paper prototype, prototype, interface, alpha/beta, product|
|Evaluate|focus groups, usability tests, user surveys, experiments, heuristic evaluations, user observations|

- involves:
	- multidisciplinary teamwork
	- iterative work practices
	- methods of acquiring user input
	- ways of converting user input to design
	
###Users and Stakeholders
**Users:** the individuals who will be interacting with your product.

**Stakeholders:**

> people or organizations who will be affected by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on system requirements. (Kotonya & Sommerville 1998)

**Examples:** Online movie ticket booking system

**Users:** moviegoers

**Stakeholders:** moviegoers, ushers, cinemas, distributors, technical staff

##Week 2 Lecture 2
###User Characteristics
**Physical** (age, gender, size, reach, weight)

**Environmental** (sound levels, table height, software)

**Perceptual abilities** (hearing, vision, heat sensitivity)

**Cognitive abilities** (memory span, reading level, tech skills)

**Personality/social traits** (likes, preferences, patience)

**Cultural traits** (language, symbols, dialog box flow)

**Psychological traits** (attitude & motivation, style)

**Job/role characteristics** (mandatory vs discretionary use, level of training, turnover rate, task importance)

###User Needs

**Maslow's hierarchy of needs**
- self-actualization: creativity, problem solving, authenticity, spontaneity
	- esteem: self-esteem, confidence, achievement
		- social needs: friendship, familty
			- safety and security
				- physiological needs (survival): air, shelter, water, food, sleep, sex
				
Understand what kind of need you are fulfilling for your users.

Make sure your design does not threaten a lower-level need while solving a higher level one.

###Research Challenges
####Data Types
#####Quantitative
numerical variables, measurements, statistics

e.g., "Participants typed at an average rate of 66 WPM with a 3% error rate."

#####Qualitative
descriptions, anecdotes, rich data in context

words, pictures, observations

e.g., "The cheap plastic-y feeling of the keyboard made users uncomfortable and hesitant to type at full speed."

#####Objective
observed facts, statistical evidence, impartial

e.g., "Users scored 78% better on system aptitude tests after a company-wide ban of social media sites."

#####Subjective
opinions, intuition, bias

e.g., "It feels cheap to me, I don't know. Did you say it was made in China?"

Lots of debate surrounding these categories.

Which is important?

###Evaluation Methods
####Sample survey
Obtain a representative sample of a population in order to understand population-wide trends and preferences. Great for **generalizability**.

####Laboratory Experiment
Perform fine measurements of user performance in tightly controlled laboratory conditions. Great for **precision**.

####Field Study
Understand underlying user needs in the wild by observing them in their environment. Great for **realism**.

###Field Study Techniques
**Naturalistic observation:** no involvement, observation only

**Questionnaires:** wide distribution, many responses

**Interviews:** great detail, adapt to responses

**Focus groups and workshops:** multiple participants, consensus

**Studying documentation:** existing process/system

**Diaries/logging:** details on duration of usage and performance

###The Problem Space
A **problem space** or **problem domain** is an area in which you have chosen to look for problems and create solutions.

##Week 3 Background Research and Study Design

###Background Research
####Typical Organization
- abstract
- introduction
- related work
- materials / methods
- results
- discussion
- limitations and future work
- conclusion

####Types of relevant publications
- human factors (cognition, perception, attention)
- practices and problems
- new interactions / interfaces
- prototypes and performance

####Human Factors
Universal characteristics of humans.

- conjecture or hypothesis that expands on some theory of cognition/perception/physiology
- controlled lab experiment
- results: principle or law about how humans work.

e.g., Fitt's Law (1954) The time required to rapidly touch a target is a function of the ratio between distance to target and diameter of target.

####Practices and Problems
Uncovers issues and suggests solutions in a particular area of human behaviour or HCI.

- concerned with particular activities
- studies users in the wild
- results: design considerations or suggestions for improvement

e.g., Thayer et al. (2011) academic reading requires support for annotation and non-linear navigation, which e-readers cannot provide, which leads to slow and reluctant adoption.

####New Interactions / Interfaces
Proposed with the idea of solving a problem or enabling new types of interactions.

- respond to a problem or limitation of current interfaces
- users participate in informing the design
- new interface / interaction is often compared to existing techniques
- results: new interface adopted and/or inspires further design.

e.g., Vogel and Casiez (2011), Conté.

####Prototypes and performance
Pushes the capabilities of hardware to enable support for better interactions in the future.

- improves on current technology on some specific metric or adds entirely new capabilities
- applications of the improved hardware not always obvious
- results: technical knowledge and more advanced hardware

E.g., TeslaTouch (2011)

###Data Gathering
####5 Key Issues
**Setting goals:** why are we gathering data?

**Identifying participants:** who are we gathering data from?

**Ethics:** are we doing any harm by gathering data?

**Triangulation:** employing different techniques to answer the same question.

**Pilot testing:** trial runs of the main study.

#####I. Setting Goals
You will conduct two rounds of user research.

In the first your goal will be to understand a problem space and to determine what issues your users are facing.

In the second you will be evalutaing how well your new design is working or would work to solve the issues discovered earlier.

#####II. Participants
Everyone to whom your question applies belongs to your **population.**

Which members of your population will you study?

- All (saturation sampling)
- A random subset (random sampling)
- A random subset in multiple categories (stratified sampling)
- Whoever you can get your hands on (convenience sampling)

#####III. Ethics
Essential principles of ethical research:

- Respect for participants
- Do no harm
- Informed consent
- Voluntary participation and right to withdraw
- Right to privacy

Typically only adults 18+ are able to give consent.

Elements:

- Disclosure: experimenter explains the purposes of the study and the procedure truthfully.
- Capacity: the participant should be able to understand the study and form a reasonable judgment with the information provided.
- Voluntariness: free of coersion, manipulation, or bias, non-conditional compensation (!)

Ethics Gone Wrong

- Nazi medical experimentation (1940s)
- The Milgram experiment (1961)
- The Standord prison experiment (1971)
- TUskegee syphillis experiment (1932-1972)

Accidental awesomeness:

- Phineas Gage (projectile iron rod)
- H.M. (epilepsy treatment)
- K.C. (motorcycle accident)

#####IV. Traingulation
Probing the same phenomenon using multiple experimental and observation techniques to obtain greater confidence in the results.

#####V. Pilot Testing
Before you deploy your study to your actual users, make sure you have thoroughly tested all the instruments (questionnaires, scripts, prototypes, etc.) you are using.

Participant time is valuable to them.

Their data is valuable to you.

##Week 4 Lecture 1  Data Gathering and Study Design
###Techniques

###Questionnaires
Administered to large samples to answer clear and concise questions: what they're doing, how much they like something, etc.

Can be administered in person or over the phone/web/email

Advantages: precision and comparability across a wide range of users.

Disadvantages: inflexible, does not adpat to individual variations or specific situations.

###Questions

Questions should be clear, brief and concise.

Questions should be few in number to avoid fatigue.

Questions should avoid unecessary jargon, biases, leading questions and making assumptions.

- **checkboxes**: provide a quick and easy way for participants to select one or more of a set of options that are already know.
- **boxes**: known quantities such as age can be asked for in a simple answer box.
- **ranges**
- **rating scales**: rating scales are used to elicit information about an attribute along a continuum.
- **scales**: the Likert scale is used to indicate the level of agreement with a series of statements. (Likert items)
	- semantic differential scales explore a range of bipolar attitudes about an item.

###Open-ended Questions
Hard to analyze.

Give participants a chance to expand on their answers.

Should be free of bias.

###Questionnaires Can and Cannot
Questionnaires **can** measure:

- data about users (demographics, cognitive abilities, personality traits)
- prior knowledge (task domain, technical expertise)
- attitudes and experiences (user satisfaction, frustration, **perceptions** of user experience)

Questionnaires **cannot** measure:

- speed, response time, erros and error rates
- how users learn commands or interfaces
- anything the user is unaware of

###Interviews
Interviews can give you detailed information about how each individual participant feels about complex issues.

**Advantages:** flexible and adaptable, rich data

**Disadvantages:** expensive, impossible to compare respondents

Types: structured, semi-structured or unstructured.

Open-ended questions: *Tell me about the last time you underlined text.*

Closed-ended questions: *Do you underline text?*

####Interview Components

- **Introduction**
	- introduce yourself
	- explain the goals of the interview
	- reassure participant about ethical issues
	- ask to record
	- present informed consent form
- **Warm-up**
	- first questions should be easy and non-threatening
- **Main body**
	- present questions in a logical order
	- follow ideas but keep interviewee on track
- **Cool-off period**
	- include a few easy questions to defuse tension at the end
- **Wrap-up / Closure**
	- thank interviewee
	- signal the end of the interview

####Challenges
- building trust
- following the script but
- allowing digression
- avoiding repetition
- timekeeping
- capturing (notetaking, audio, video)
- multitasking: talking, listening, filtering, notetaking
- bias

##Week 4 Lecture 2 Data Gathering and Study Design (continued)

January 28, 2015

###Data Gathering
####Evaluation Methods
**Questionnaires**: Many respondents, concise questions. Great for **generalizability**.

**Interviews**: Detailed, qualitative data. Great for **context and depth**.

**Observation**: Understand underlying user needs in the wild by observing them in their environment. Great for **realism**.

**Laboratory Experiment**: Perform fine measurements of user performance in tightly controlled laboratory conditions. Great for **precision.**

####The need for observation
Both questionnaries and interviews can only elicit responses that participants are aware of.

They rely on participants assessing their own attitudes and being truthful.

Observations show you how participants are performing tasks and what issues they are encountering at the moment they occur.

#####Direct Observation in the field
Observing participants as they perform a task in their usual environment, taking context into account.

- fly on the wall
- asking questions
- immersive participation

things to focus on:
- **Person**: who is using the technology?
- **Place**: what are their surroundings like?
- **Thing**: what are they doing? are they having issues?

Observation changes the data (Hawthorne effect)

####D.O In a Controlled Environment
Observing participants as they perform a task in an environment designed to focus on specific task details rather than context.

makes participants apprehensive.

gives more precision and control over confounding factors, minimizes interruption.

**think-aloud protocol**: ask participant to vocialize their thoughts as they are performing a task.

####Indirect Observation
**Diaries:** Ask participant to fill out a daily form detailing their activities.

**Logs**: collect automatic usage data from devices.

**Documentation or history**: study artifacts of tasks performed before experienter was involved.

###Laboratory Experiments

####Laboratory Experiments
Lab experiments are designed to gather simple, quantitative data that can be generalized across participants and through repeated trials.

**Advantages:** accurate measurement of performance metrics (Response time, pointing accuracy), instrumentation, complete control over the environment, ability to isolate required task.

**Disadvantages:** no relation to how task is performed in the real world.

e.g., one-handed iPhone 6 plus.

####Collecting data
What's better: questionnaire, interview, or observation study?

*How far do users drive to the commuter station?*

*What steps do they go through to plan a route?*

*Do they prefer to use a touch screen monitor or issue a voice command?*

*What do they carry in their briefcase?*

####Must-read
Participant Observation (Mack 2005)

Designing useful and usable questionnaires (Wilson 2007)

Semi-structured interviewing for user-centered design (Wood 1997)

##Week 5 Lecture 1 User Research and Requirements

February 2, 2015

###Phase 2 components:
- detailed user research plan
- instruments
	- study protocol
	- informed consent form
	- three different instruments: interview scripts, observation scripts, questionnaires, etc.
	
**bring 5 copies of instruments to tutorial this week for pilot testing**

###User Research and Requirements
Users remember:

- The **lowest points** when the system frustrated or failed the user.
- The **highest points** when things went exceptionally well or smoothly
- The **most recent points** which are still fresh in the user's memory

The lowest points are processed more and remembered in more detail. [Baumeister 2001]

####Source of Bias
**Users** not well chosen, not generalizable

**Questions** not appropriate or unclear

**Setting** familiarity, comfort, relevance

**Researcher** asking leading questions, judgment, feeling of being observed

**Methodology** poorly suited to research question

**Data analysis** issues such as inter-rater reliability

**Reporting** results not directly deriving from data

####User Research in ID
The purpose of conducting research on users is to understand them:

- User profiles (who your users are)
- Stakeholders (who else is affected by system)
- Tasks (what are users trying to do)
- Environment (what is happening around them)
- Artifacts (what other objects/interfaces are they using)


####Requirements
You are conducting research in order to better understand the **requirements** of your users, and what they will eventually need your new design to do.

**e.g.,** Coffee shop tips: customers paying with cards are much less likely to tip than those paying cash.

####Environmental Requirements
or the context of use for your system:

What's the physical environment like?

What's the social environment like? would using your system inconvenience or confuse others?

What is the organizational environment?

How easy is tech support to obtain?

Are there stakeholders who control or influence your users?

####Functional Requirements

or what your system needs to be able to do:

What is your system doing in general terms?

what are the specific capabilities that the above requires?

how will your system support them?

####Technical requirements

or how your system needs to be built:

are there constraints to the technologies you can use (modality, emissions, battery life, etc.)

Price, size, weight, etc.

Compatibility and integration with other technologies

data storage requirements

####Usability requirements

or how easy to use should your system be:

ease of learning: iPhone vs. Boeing cockpit

ease of use

protection from, and recovery from "errors"

#####e.g. [DipJar](https://www.dipjar.com)

####Personas

A **persona** is a hypothetical user archetype used throughout the design process.

Personas are not users, rather they are amalgamations of user goals, motivations and behaviours seen in data from real people.

The persona will include a description not only of the goals, but also of the characteristics of the user archetype: skills, attitudes, etc.

**Primary personas** are used to define the most common types of users.

####Persona elements

Group (e.g., airline passengers)

Fictional name

Job titles/responsibilities

Demographics: age, education, ethnicity, family status

Goals and tasks

Physical, social and technological environment

A quote that sums up what matters most to them about the product

####Primary persona

Demonstrates key goals and behaviour patterns.

If the design fails for a primary persona, the product will fail.

Each primary persona may require a different interface.

**Example:** a family electronic calendar.

Possible primary personas:

- Nancy, a career mom
- Stephen, a stay-at-home dad
- Slash, a forgetful teenager

####Primary persona example

####Creating personas II
A persona acts as a character to designers and is written to encompass a salient range of details while helping designers relate to their user base.

Alliterating persona names with their main titles will help you talk about them:

Manager Molly, Slacker Steve, Tech Support Terrence...

####Families/Groups of Personas
A group of primary personas is useful if/when (mostly when) the range of your users cannot be represented by a single primary persona. E.g., univeristy students:

- Affulent Alice
- Commuter Kyle
- International Ingrid
- Mature Morris
- Poor Peter
- Limited means Larry

####Scenarios
Narrative is a powerful design tool.

A **scenario** is an informal narrative description of users or personas using artifacts within environments to carry out tasks and activities.

Scenarios focus on the current state of users' activities and exclude the proposed system.

Scenarios have all the elements of narratives: characters, conflict, plot, resolution.

####Example

##Week 5 Lecture 2

February 4, 2015

###Hierarchical Task Analysis

Understanding the steps required in critical tasks at multiple levels of abstraction is important to correctly designing for the task. 

There are many techniques for this, and they can take many formats. We will focus on one particular technique: **Hierarchical Task Analysis** [Annett & Duncan 1967].

**HTA** produces a list of design-agnostic numbered hierarchical steps required to achieve a task. Steps are grouped into **plans** to indicate how a task might be accomplished.

e.g.

1. Borrow a book from the library [SRP 2011]:
2. Go to library
3. Find the required book
	- access library catalogue
	- access the search screen
	- enter search criteria
	- identify required book
	- note location
4. Go to correct shelf and retrieve book
5. Take book to checkout counter

###HTA Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- Let you compare alternative designs based on number of steps and support for users' planned tasks and subtasks
- provides an understanding of the interaction at the appropriate level of abstraction.

**Cons**:

- Does not scale well to real tasks
- Limited to non-concurrent, non-overlapping, uninterrupted tasks



###Task Analysis

##Week 6 Lecture 1 User Research and Requirements II

February 9, 2015

###Reporting results
It is important to reports in ways that are appropriate for the population, sample, and the problem chosen.

The crucial thing to avoid in A3 is statement that overgeneralize based on your results or that imply a greater level of measuring precision than was in your study.

with small numbers of users, population-wide statements and percentages are inappropriate.

###Design principles
Set of commandments or general principles that express your high-level vision for the system.

They should be brief, memorable, and specific. They should apply across your entire system, differentiate you from your competitors, and they should not conflict with each other.

###Short Form Creative Brief
The SFCB is a very short, constantly evolving document that is read before each meeting to ensure all members of a team are focused on the problem at hand.

1. Project objective (2-3 sentences)
2. Key personas (1-2 personas)
3. Key scenarios (3-4 scenarios)
4. Key design principles

###Experience Map
In order to situate your eventual design for a particular set of tasks, use cases and users, you should understand how it fits in the overall **user experience.**

An **experience map** is a tool to help you do so. It focuses on understanding the user's overall experience with a domain, platform or system.

###Experience Model
from anthropological research on ritual experiences, they unfold in the following five steps:

**Entice:** attract you, build anticipation and set expectations.

**Enter:** guide and orient you into experience

**Engage:** ritual artifact engages senses and maintains connection

**Exit:** guided to a new, transformed state

**Extend:** reminders keep you connected to experience

###Experience Model Example

Walt Disney World

| | |
|:-|:-|
|Entice|Movies, ads, promises of carefree holiday|
|Enter|Magical express, park maps, signage|
|Engage|Attractions, theming, characters|
|Exit|Transition back to "real world"|
|Extend|Souvenirs, follow-up maps, photos|

###Experience Map
The experience map is a tool for you as designers to understand the overall expereince and to identify:

- "bright spots" - where does the experience offer delight or work exceptionally well?
- "hot spots" - where does the experience break down and fail users?
- "gaps" - where is there no support for the user's experience?


###Experience Maps: Your Task

Create a table in which the columns are chronological steps that parallel the 5 E's (but can be different, e.g., "Park-Enter-Orient-Eat-Play-Exit-Go home").

| |Park|Enter|...|
|:-|:-|:-||
|People|||
|Context|||
|Thinking|||
|Feeling|||
|Doing|||
|Touchpoints|||

Who is involved (users/personas)

How did they get here

What info do they have

Happy/frustrated with the system

What are they trying to do

What are they interacting with

##Week 6 Lecture 2

##Week 7 Lecture 1 Prototyping
February 23, 2015

###Design

Early design <-> Late design <-> Development

Low fidelity <-> High fidelity

###Wireframes
A **wireframe** is a low-fidelity visual schematic that represents the skeletal framework of a webpage or digital interface.

Wireframes are unconcerned with visual qualities, only with conveying relative placement, functionality and role of components.

They are used within a design team, by programmers and implementers of the system as **blueprints** for the layout of an interface.

Wireframes are generally **static** and non-interactive.

###Mockups
A **mockup** is a high-fidelity rendering of the visual elements of a system: colours, typefaces, etc.

Mockups are relatively expensive and invite discussions of the visual and aesthetic qualities of the design.

They solicit fine-grained, detail-oriented feedback and should be used to fine-tune a design in the latter stages once more significant design and interaction issues have been resolved.

Like wireframes, mockups are **static** and **non-interactive**.

###Prototypes
A **prototype** is "a sample of a part or product fabricated in advance of production to allow demonstration, evaluation, or testing of the product."

*proto* (first, initial) + *typos* (image, impression)

We use prototypes to illustrate and evaluate our products and systems with end users, usability experts and team members.

Prototypes of digital systems are **interactive**, i.e., they demonstrate how the system would react to user actions.

###Prototype Fidelity
Fidelity: how faithful is the prototype to the final system's look and feel?

**low fidelity:**

- does not resemble final product, operation slower
- faster to create and iterate
- obviously low-investment, encourages experimentation

**high fidelity:**

- looks and operates like real product
- more accurate: comments related to final design
- false sense of completeness and focus on details

###Prototype Technologies

from *early* to *late*:

- paper: nothing is automated
- presentation software: choose-your-own-next-screenf
- dedicated prototyping tools (variable)
- HTML/CSS/JS: interactive links but no "guts"
- final system platform/technology: interaction + guts

###Prototyping Functionality
**Question:** How do you prototype a system that has not actually been implemented yet?

**Answer:** *The Wizard of Oz*

###Prototyping: Breadth vs. Depth
- **Breadth:** demonstrates the amount of features, options and commands. Each feature is rendered, but cannot be followed very far.
- **Depth:** shows interactivity and functionality. All but a few critical features are inactive "dead ends".
- "horizontal prototypes (favors features)" vs. "vertical prototypes (favors functionalities)"

###Prototyping Scenarios
It is expected that not every interaction or path will be explored in every prototype.

Constrain user interaction and the prototype implementation to yield the type of feedback that would be most useful.

Why/what are you prototyping?

- proof of concept
- visual design, screen layout, information display.
- form & physical attributes
- interaction, workflow, tasks
- functional model
- difficult, controversial, critical areas

###Paper prototyping

- paper is cheap, easy and universally understood
- paper is instantly customizable, malleable, and unconstraining
- encourages creativity

###Conceptual model
A **conceptual model** is "a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates"

Designers has a conceptual model for their system, what it's supposed to do, how it works, etc.

It enables "designer to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets"

Forming a conceptual model for your system is an essential step in designing for it.

A designer's conceptual model is structured, logical and consistent. They know everything about their system and how it is supposed to work.

Users form their own models which are based solely on interacting with the system.

Users' models are ad hoc, informal and incomplete.

Sometimes they're incoherent, illogical, emotional, even superstitious (fear of upgrades).



##Week 7 Lecture 2 Prototyping ii

###Conceptual Models

####User models and game design
Games are structured, carefully designed interactive experiences.

###Conceptual model components
A conceptual model is built from:

- **Affordances** (what things can do) and **Signifiers** (what things look like they can do)
- **Constraints** (what things are made not to do)
- **Mappings** (how things relate to user's prior knowledge)
- **Metaphors** (how things relate to user's prior knowledge)
- **Standards** and **norms** (how things should be)
- **Instructions** (what users are told to do)
- **Interactions** (what users learn by interacting with the system)

###Affordances
"**Affordances** are the actions possible by a specific agent on a specific environment."

**perceived affordances**

Every pixel affords clicking.

###Signifiers
**Signifiers** are "clues to understanding the product or service, some sign of what it is for, what is happening and what the alternative actions are."

###Signifiers vs Affordances
Affordances are **fixed** and somewhat incidental.

Signifiers are **deliberate:** designers use them to highlight perceived affordances for the user.

Signifiers separate the important **information** (object is for sitting) from the **noise** (object is throwable, breakable, tippable, burnable, etc.)

###Signifiers vs Affordances
Affordances are **fixed** and somewhat incidental.

Signifers are **deliberate**...

###Constraints
**Constraints** limit the set of possible actions with an object or system to make proper use more likely.

They help make perceived affordances a subset of safe affordances.

###Physical Interface Constraints
###Digital Interface Constraints

###Mapping Targets
**Natural mappings** reduce cognitive load on the user by making it immediately obvious which control is associated with which object.

- Proximity
- Similarity
- Correspondence

###Mapping Outcome

###Standards and Norms
**Standards** in interface design are expectations that are binding and explicitly stated.

Standards may be imposed by an OS, by the underlying technology, by human factors research, etc.

E.g., QWERTY vs DVORAK, minimal size of clickable elemetns, "Material design".

**Norms**are expectations that are implicit and ...

###Metaphors
**Metaphors** are ways of relating aspects of an interface to familiar objects or concepts.

In literature, a metaphor is "a figure of speech in which a term or phase"...

...

###Metaphors vs Idioms
Metaphors have great initial utility to get users to form conceptual models for new interfaces.

However, they lose potency cover time by tethering rapidly changing digital interfaces to a rigid real-world definitions.

What are some metaphors that have outlived their original domains?

**Idioms** are less intuitive than metaphors, don't exploit prior knowledge, but also don't commit the user to an aging association.

###Idioms

**Idioms** are learned conventions of interaction that do not have real-world equivalents.

They are less intuitive than mataphors, don't exploit prior knowledge, but ...

###Why Idioms?

###7 universal deep metaphors
**balance:** creating or restoring justice/symmetry.

**transformation:** change, typically for the better.

**journey:** includes past, present and future.

**container:** inclusion, collection, exclusion.

**connnection:** need to relate to oneself and others.

**resource:** acquisition and growth.

**control:** mastery and free will.

###Instructions
**Instructions** are ...

###Heuristics and Heuristic Evaluation

A **heuristic** is an experience-based "rule of thumb" that helps find a workable, but not necessarily perfect or proven, solution to a problem at hand.

In interface design, it is one of a set of well-established...

###Nielsen's Heuristics (1994)
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

###7 "Laws" of UI Design
1. Law of clarity: convey purpose clearly.
2. Law of preferred action: make preferred action prominent ad well supported.
3. Law of context: put controls near targets.
4. Law of defaults: make defaults usable.
5. Law of guided action: ask the user to do things.
6. Law of feedback: provide clear and concise feedback.
7. Law of easing: break complex actions into simpler steps.
