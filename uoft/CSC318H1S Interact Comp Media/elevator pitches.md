since our project is targeting learners/users of CLI, we plan to do the survey in school because students in 1st/2nd year are usually amatuer in this area. So basically the form of our survey would be on-machine trial + some Q&A. Specifically we have some tasks for the interviewee to do, in order to stratify our data into different strata. And after that, we have some very subjective questions for our interviewees to answer, like what do you think about CLIs in general/ What was the haredest part about learning CLI...


##week 5

`describing the research instruments and how we're going to use them`

problem space is learning and using experience of CLI

the general order of our instruments is: first questionnaire to gather basic information, then the observation is optional since it happens if and only if the subejct is familiar with CLI, and finally the interview which is very subjective like how do you feel about CLI, what's the most difficult part of learning/using CLI.

Well basically, in order to prevent overlapping, we are trying to make a workflow for these instruments, like under what scenario should we ask the research subject this and if the answer is yes what are we gonna do... and it will be included with details in p2.

stakeholders would be those potential students who never use it but will start using it in the future.
