#Weekly Assignments
There will be about 10 assignments during the term.  (Approximately one per week.)

The secret to succeeding in the course is to do exercises regularly - don't leave it until just before the tests (that generally leads to failure.)

The point of the assignments is to help keep you caught up with the course.  

But - make sure you do exercises beyond the assignments as well!

Most of the assignments will be on Logic 2010 - so make sure you register on Logic 2010 as soon as possible.  

The first assignment is a Blackboard Quiz - it will be posted here on January 9.
