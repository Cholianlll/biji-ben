plot(predict(m1),residuals(m1,type="pearson"),xlab="Fitted values",ylab="Residuals")
# Here residuals(m1,type="pearson") is the residuals for WLS. For OLS, 
# the Pearson residuals and the ordinary residuals are the same, so this 
# option can be used for all least squares models.

abline(h=0,lty=3)

# According to theory, if the mean function and other assumptions are 
# correct, then all possible residual plots of residuals versus any 
# function of the terms should be resemble a null plot, so many plots of 
# residuals should be examined. Usual choices include plots verse each 
# of the terms and versus fitted values, as shown in Figure 8.5 in 
# textbook for the consumption data.

# Test can be computed to help decide if residual plots are null plots 
# or not. One helpful test looks for curvature in this plot.
# One can mannually fit model with the quadratic term, where I(.) is to protect math operation

# The command "residualPlots" implements the curvature tests describe 
# in section 8.2 of textbook. For example, all the plots in Figure 8.5 
# except for part (f), along with a fitted quadratic curve, and the 
# curvature tests, are obtained using 
residualPlots(m1)

# The "qqnorm" command is used to draw normal probability plots.
