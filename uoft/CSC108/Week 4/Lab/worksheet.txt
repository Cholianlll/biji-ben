=== Booleans: Warmup Exercise ===

Please answer the following questions on separate a piece of paper. Do your
work individually, without your partner.


1.  my_account is a float variable representing the amount of money in my
    bank account.

    a.  Create a boolean variable "rich" which will be True if and only if I 
        have at least a million dollars in the account.
        
    min_balance is another float variable representing the minimum
    balance I need to maintain to avoid service charges. The bank
    changes this amount from time to time.
    
    b.  Create a boolean variable "close" that is True if and only if
        my account has at least the minimum balance, but is dangerously
		close (within 30.00 of the minimum balance).


2.  A student may get into CSCB67 (not a real course) if they have a
    GPA of 2.7 or higher, and  if they have taken at least one of:
    CSCA08 or CSCA20. 
    
    g is a float variable representing my current GPA, and a08 and a20 
    are booleans: a08 is True if and only if I have taken CSCA08, and 
    a20 is True if and only if I have taken CSCA20.

    a.  Write a Python expression with the variables g, a08 and a20 that 
        evaluates to True if I can take CSCB67, and to false otherwise
    
    Now, assume that we don't know what my actual GPA is, (we don't
    have the float g) but we have a bool variable b which represents 
    whether my GPA is at least 2.7.

    b.  Write another expression, using b, a08, and a20: it should
    evaluate to True if I can take B67, and to False otherwise.
