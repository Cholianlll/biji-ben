#Utilitarianism
(1) You ought to do act A iff the happiness/unhappiness balance that would result from your doing A is **greater than** what would result from your not doing A;

(2) You ought **not** to act A iff the happiness/unhappiness balance that would result from your doing A is **less than** what would result from your not doing A.

Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), J.S. Mill (1806-1873)

#4 "Elements" of Utilitarianism

1. **Consequentialism** - actions are judged right/wrong solely by virtue of their actual consequences.
2. **Aggregation** - One consequence C1 is better than - has a higher utility than - another C2 if the sum of what's good for each person involved in C1 minus what's bad for them is greater than the sum of what's good for each person involved in C2 minus what's bad for them.
3. **Hedonism** - The only thing that is intrinsically good is happiness, i.e. "Pleasure and the absence of pain." All other things are merely instrumentally good.
4. **Agent Neutrality** - No one's happiness should be counted as more important than anyone else'. Your welfare and my welfare are equally important.

#What makes Utilitarianism plausible?

It expresses **3 plausible moral ideas**:

1. that morality is concerned with human welfare;
2. that what each of us ought morally to aim at is to bring about as much good as possible;
3. that morality is impartial.

#Rawls (1921-2002)
- "Problem of Justice"?

- 2 principles of Justice

##Principle 1 (p302-303)
Each person is to have an equal right tot the most extensive scheme of "equal basic liberties" compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for others.

*e.g.* Right to vote, freedom of speech, right to hold personal property etcâ€¦

##Principle 2
aka the **"Difference Principle"**: Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both:

1. reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage, and
2. attached to positions and offices open to all.

*Principle 1 takes priority over Principle 2.*

*Rawls is **Egalitarianism Libertarian**.*

#Robert Nozick

A conception of Justice is **"Patterned"** if it aims to put into place a distribution of resources that varies along some natural dimension.

A conception is **"Historical"** if it sees the Justice of a distribution not in terms of whether the distribution conforms to some pattern, but in terms of the actual history of how persons come to acquire resources.

##Entitlement Theory
Entitlement theory is a theory of distributive justice and private property created by Robert Nozick in his book *Anarchy, State, and Utopia*. The theory is Nozick's attempt to describe "justice in holdings" (Nozick 1974:150) - or what can be said about and done with the property people own when viewed from a principle of justice.

Nozick's entitlement theory comprises 3 main principles:

1. **A principle of justice in acquisition** - This principle deals with the initial acquisition of holdings. It is an account of how people first come to own common property, what types of things can be held, and so forth.
2. **A principle of justice in transfer** - This principle explains how one person can acquire holdings from another, including voluntary exchange and gifts.
3. **A principle of rectification of injustice** - how to deal with holdings that are unjustly acquired or transferred, whether and how much victims can be compensated, how to deal with long past transgressions or injustices done by a government, and so on.

Nozick believes that if the world were wholly just, only the first two principles would be needed, as "the following inductive definition would exhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings":

1. A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in acquisition is entitled to that holding.
2. A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in transfer, from someone else entitled to the holding, is entitled to the holding.
3. No one is entitled to a holding except by (repeated) applications of 1 and 2. (p310)

Thus, entitlement theory would imply "a distribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they possess under the distribution" (Nozick 1974:151). Unfortunately, not everyone follows these rules: "some people steal from others, or defraud them, or enslave them, seizing their product and preventing them from living as they choose, or forcibly exclude others from competing in exchanges" (Nozick 1974:152). Thus the third principle of rectification is needed.

Entitlement theory is based on John Locke's ideas. Under entitlement theory, people are represented as ends in themselves and equals, as Kant claimed, though different people may own (i.e. be entitled to) different amounts of property. Nozick's ideas create a strong system of private property and a free-market economy. The only just transaction is a voluntary one. Taxation of the rich to support social programs for the poor are unjust because the state is acquiring money by force instead of through a voluntary transaction.

**Wilt's example fails Rawls' theory, since if you really let people do what they want, they are going the mess up your pattern, then the only way to prevent this is to restrict people to do things freely.**
