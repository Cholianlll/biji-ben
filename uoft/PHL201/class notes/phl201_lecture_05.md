###Body Theory/ Brain Theory

###Psychological Theory

Persons are ongoing **STREAMS** of **psychological connectedness**. X is the same person as Y iff X and Y are psychologically connected in the right kind of way.

###Memory Theory (Locke)

Persons are ongoing streams of **memory connections**. X is the same person as Y iff X remembers at least some of what Y did, thought, and felt.

*What Locke is talking about* is "**episodic**" memory

"EPISODIC" memory (doing, thinking and feeling)

vs.

"FACTUAL" memory (FACT; information)

vs.

"ACQUAINTANCE" memory (like how to ride a bike, what my cousin looks like, etc.)

##Reid

He proposed a famous objection to Locke's theory of personal identity.

- Transitivity?
- Name schoolboy A, officer B and general C. then we assume general remembers when he was an officer, and the officer remembers when he was a schoolboy, but the general doesn't remember when he was a schoolboy.
- now we have: B = C, A = B, but A != C (according to Locke)
- But we know that they are the same person, i.e. A = B = C.

###Memory connection

X and Y are **memory connected** iff X remembers at least some of what Y did, thought, felt.

###Memory Continuity

X and Y are **memory continuous** iff Y is the last link in a chain of persons beginning with X which is such that each person in the chain is memory connected with the preceding person.

##Consequences of Locke/Reid's theory of PERSONAL IDENTITY:

SLEEP?

AMNESIA?

DRUNKENNESS?

##Derek Parfit

Suppose we have a perfect teleporter that can make a blueprint for you while you are on it, which includes all of your psychological components, then the other end of the teleporter on Mars duplicate successfully and completely another "you". Does this mean "you" travelled to Mars? Or is that "you" or other person?

(Assume A is on earth, and B, C on Mars.)

A = B, A != C

A = C, A != B

A = B & A =C

A != B, A != C

#Justified True Belief (by Plato)

Justified true belief is a definition of knowledge that is most frequently credited to Plato and his dialogues.

The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but one must also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, a subject S knows that a proposition P is true if and only if:

1. P is true
2. S believes that P is true, and
3. S is justified in believing that P is true

This theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of Gettier problems, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but that many philosophers disagree that anything is known. Robert Nozick suggested a clarification of "justification" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false.
