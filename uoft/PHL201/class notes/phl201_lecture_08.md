- Glaucon's Challenge
- Cultural (moral) Relativism
- Egoism
- Parfit?

---
##Glaucon:
**NOMOS** (Custom, convention) VS. **PHUSIS** (Nature)

e.g. for nomos, like drinking in different states/provinces/countries.

###3 Goods:
1. for its own sake **only** (like fun?)
2. for its own sake **and** for its consequences (like education) *TEAM SOCRATES*
3. for its consequences **only** (like going to a dentist) *TEAM GLAUCON*

**Socrates believes justice belongs to the *second* kind.**

**Glaucon believes justice belongs to the *third*.**

###3 Clams about justice:
1. its origins
2. that it's practiced "unwillingly" i.e. as good #3
3. that people are **right** to take this view about justice

##Moral (Cultural) Relativism

*The elements of moral philosophy* by James Rachels.

**A.** there is no universal moral truth. in other words, there are no moral truths that hold for all people at all time.

**B.** there are moral truths

**C.** moral truths are relative to a certain moral framework: claims like "Sam morally ought to give to charity" should be taken to be equivalent to claims like "relative to moral framework F, Sam morally ought to give more to charity."

***"Moral framework"*** = a set of rules governing what kinds of actions to consider right/wrong, what sorts of situations to consider good/bad, what kinds of persons are praiseworthy/blameworthy.

##(WEAK) Argument for Moral Relativism
1. Different cultures disagree, sometimes radically, about morality.

**SO** there is no universal moral truth.

**WEAK** because:

- Only establishes Moral Relativism's A not A, B, C
- Does even the stated conclusion follow from the premise? What about Rachels' geography example.

This is not *sound*. James Rachels uses the sentences:

>We are not saying (not yet, anyway) that the conclusion of the argument is *false*. That is still an open question. The logical point is just that the conclusion does not *follow from* the premise. This is important, because in order to determine whether the conclusion is true, we need arguments in its support.

##BETTER Argument for Moral Relativism
1. FACT: Different cultures disagree, sometimes radically, about morality.
2. This fact requires explanation.
3. ! The only reasonable explanation for this disagreement is the hypothesis of moral relativity. (i.e. **A, B, C**)
4. *Inference to the best explanation*: if a fact **F** requires explanation and if hypothesis **H** is the only reasonable explanation of **F**, then it's reasonable to believe **H**.

It's reasonable to believe **Moral Relativism**.

##Objections to Moral Relativism: (P243)
1. If Moral Relativism is true, then we can't say that the customs of other societies are morally inferior to our own.
2. If Moral Relativism is true, the we can decide whether actions are right/wrong *just by* consulting the standards of our own society.
3. If Moral Relativism is true, the the idea of moral progress is called into doubt.

Using Rachels' words to answer why there is less disagreement than it seems:

>The point is that many factors work together to produce the customs of a society. The society's values are only one of them. Other matters, such as the religious and factual beliefs held by its members, and the physical circumstances in which they must live, are also important. We cannot conclude, then, merely because customs differ, that there is a disagreement about values. The difference in customs may be attributable to some other aspect of social life. Thus there may be less disagreement about values than there appears to be.

WHY some values in common?

>There are some moral rules that all societies must have in common.

##Psychological Egoism:
the only thing anyone does pursue *as an end of itself* is her own self-interest.
