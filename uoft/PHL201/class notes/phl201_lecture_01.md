###Class materials

Arguments are the way philosophers to convince people.

First lesson: 
>**Arguments are not bad things!**

Arguments are lists of propositions. 逻辑论证

Propositions are just statements, can be right or wrong. 命题

PHILOSOPHERS ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE, they are giving people reasons why they should believe your conclusion.

e.g.

**reason1**: no professors are ignorant.

**reason2**: all ignorant people are vain.

**conclusion**: no professors are vain.

- **ENTAILMENT蕴涵**: A conclusion is entailed by its premises前提 just in case it's impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false.

	entailment is the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one (A) requires the truth of the other (B).

- AN ARGUMENT IS VALID有效 JUST IN CASE ITS CONCLUSION IS ENTAILED BY ITS PREMISES.
- In logic, an argument is valid if and only if its conclusion is logically entailed by its premises and each step in the argument is logical. A formula is valid if and only if it is true under every interpretation, and an argument form (or schema) is valid if and only if every argument of that logical form is valid.
- AN ARGUMENT IS SOUND合理 JUST IN CASE IT'S VALID AND ALL ITS PREMISES ARE TRUE.
- An argument is sound if and only if a)The argument is valid. b)All of its premises are true.

###READING NOTES

在《證據》（Proslogion）中，安瑟倫僅僅藉「神」的概念，就證明神的存在，並提出本體論的重要內涵：「我們不能夠想像得比它更大的東西，他就存在。」《證據》第二章。

所謂的上帝就是「無法設想比它更偉大或更完美的那一位存在者」，這是安瑟倫本體論證的邏輯前提。上帝是一切存有的原因，但祂自己卻不以任何他物為其原因，祂是「憑自身」而存在。即當本質上是最真、善、美的時候，那就是存在；當存在和本質相同的時候，那就是上帝 。但若「最完美者」僅存於意識裡，而不存見於現實時，便不是最完美之存在。因為它還可以讓人思想一個更完全，且兼具觀念之存在與現實的存在者。因此，最完全者之概念不但具有思想上之實在，且須具有絕對之實在。

在安瑟倫的論述，以「最完美者」之概念，證明最完美者之現實存在，然而「最完美者」之概念為一思想，是建構在精神上的實質，即人的意識當中。而人對神的認知僅是心智直覺及客觀現象（絕對者之存在）之存在 ，他將「理想中的存在」與「現實中的存在」混為一談。安瑟倫的本體論論證，遭到了不少經院哲學家的批評，其中一位法國馬牟節的僧侶高尼羅（Gaunilon），以匿名出版的《為愚人辯》（Pro Insipiente）。綜合他對安瑟倫本體論的批評：「從思想與實體予以區別，我們或許儘可意想或想像一個實體，但此一實體儘可不全存在。」 高尼羅指出理解的東西並非等於真實的東西，心靈中的存在未必等同現實中的存在。高尼羅身為僧侶，顯然不是無神論者。其相關批評只是挑剔安瑟倫本體論證上的邏輯破綻，並無意否認上帝的存在，卻使後人意識安瑟倫本體論證的不圓滿，從而轉向更嚴謹的認識論來思考 。

In his Proslogion, Anselm put forward a proof of the existence of God called the "ontological argument". The term itself was first applied by Immanuel Kant to the arguments of Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century rationalists. Anselm defined his belief in the existence of God using the phrase "that than which nothing greater can be conceived". He reasoned that, if "that than which nothing greater can be conceived" existed only in the intellect, it would not be "that than which nothing greater can be conceived", since it can be thought to exist in reality, which is greater. It follows, according to Anselm, that "that than which nothing greater can be conceived" must exist in reality. The bulk of the Proslogion is taken up with Anselm's attempt to establish the identity of "that than which nothing greater can be conceived" as God, and thus to establish that God exists in reality.

Anselm's ontological proof has been the subject of controversy since it was first published in the 1070s. It was opposed at the time by the monk Gaunilo, in his Liber pro Insipiente, on the grounds that humans cannot pass from intellect to reality. Anselm replied to the objections in his Responsio.

Gaunilo's criticism is repeated by several later philosophers, among whom are Thomas Aquinas and Kant. Anselm wrote a number of other arguments for the existence of God, based on cosmological and teleological grounds.
