Assignment 2 is coming.

##Argument from Skepticism

**P1)** Our evidence for the external world propositions we believe doesn't guarantee that any of them is true.

**C1)** We aren't evidentially certain of any propositions about the external world. **[P1, definition of evidential certainty]**

**P2)** Knowledge requires evidential certainty.

**C2)** We don't know any propositions about the external world. **[C1, P2]**

##Moore vs. The Skeptic
**P1)** If one doesn't know that one isn't dreaming, then one doesn't know that one is standing and awake. ***SKPETIC***

**P2)** You don't know that you aren't dreaming. ***MOORE CHALLENGES***

**C2)** You don't know that you're standing and awake.

---
##Moore
**P1)** If one doesn't know that one isn't dreaming, then one doesn't know that one is standing and awake.

**P2)** You do know that you are standing and awake.

**C)** You do know that you aren't dreaming.

##Moore's proof of an external world
**P1)** Here is a hand (said while gesturing with one's left hand).

**P2)** Here is another hand (said while gesturing with one's right hand).

**C1)** Two human hands now exist. **[P1, P2]**

**P3)** If two human hands now exist, then there are external objects. **(IMPLICIT)**

**C2)** There are external objects. **[C1, P3]**

---
##Moore's "TEST" for a rigorous proof:
**I)** Premises are different from the conclusion (i.e. C1 *could* be true even if P1 & P2 were false).

**II)** Premises are known to be true (Moore: it could be "absurd" to deny he knows P1 & P2).

**III)** Conclusion follows from the premises (i.e. if two hands are here, then two hands now exist).

But what about the premises? Doesn't Moore have to *prove* P1 & P2?

>Moore:

>1. It may be impossible to prove P1 & P2.
>2. Nevertheless, we can know things that we cannot prove.

##Chalmers
Skeptical Hypothesis:

1. Can't be ruled out. **[Moore's target]**
2. If true, it would render false most of our beliefs. **[Chalmers' target]**

###A. Creation Hypothesis:
Physical space-time and its contents were created by beings outside physical space-time.

###B. Computational Hypothesis:
Microphysical processes throughout space-time are constituted by underlying computational processes.

###C. Mind-Body Hypothesis:
Our minds are (and always have been) constituted by processes outside physical space-time and receive their perceptual inputs from and send their outputs to processes in physical space-time.

###Metaphysical Hypothesis:
A Hypothesis about the underlying nature of reality.

Chalmers believes even if A-C true, it doesn't prove the external world is false. So being in the Matrix for your whole life still can be true, it's true to "you".

#Republic
What is JUSTIC & why does it PAY FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS IT?

NOMOS (custom) vs. PHYSIS

Thrasymachus

Glaucon

Glaucon is asking, why be moral?

---

Glaucon: assume three sorts of ***goods***

1. For its **own** sake only. e.g. simple pleasures.
2. Good for their own sake **and** their consequences.
3. Good for consequences **only**.

take doing exercises as an example, people who only enjoy the process of doing itself would take it as a good for their own sake, but some other people would just take it as a good for consequences only.

another extreme example: a risky heart surgeryâ€¦

Justice is like a "risky heart surgery".
