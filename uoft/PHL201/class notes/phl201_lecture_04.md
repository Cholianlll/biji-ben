##What is Determinism? (causal determinism = CD)
Think about the "ball" example from last lecture, if we know everything physical laws we need, we can perfectly predict the motion in the ball, thus free will is impossible!

##Arguments from **DETERMINISM**

1. Everything that happens is determined by *prior* events (CD)
2. One acts freely only if one has the power to do otherwise (choice condition) 
		
		if not, why should I go to jail for stealing, since I cannot avoid stealing?
		
3. If one's actions are determined, then one lacks the power to act otherwise
 
**conclusion**: No one ever acts freely (1, 2, 3)

###**INCOMPATIBILISM**

only one of CD and human freedom is true.

***hard determinism***: a broad view that causal determinism is incompatible with human freedom, and CD is true, so human freedom must be false, it's an illusion.

***libertarianism (Chisholm)***: it agrees with hard determinsm if causal determinism were true that human freedom is false, but what they differ is that libertarianism believes that we are free, so it is that CD is false.
	
###**COMPATIBILISM**

both of CD and human freedom are true, they accept 1 is true, gonna choose either 2 or 3 true) (Ayer chose 3 true.

here are two compatibilists:

**Hume**: You do X freely if and only if (I) you do X and (II) doing X is what you choose to do. (prototype of Compatibilism)

*Why is this a prototype? It has some faults:*

e.g. If my arm is forced to raise up and down forever by a robot, then I force myself to think, hmm I am wanting my arm to move up and down. Now, is it a freedom? No, I am "pretending to act freely". 	

Okay, here comes an updated/expanded version (with a longer clause):

**Ayer**: You do X freely if and only if (I) you do X, (II) doing X is what you choose to do, and **(III) if you had chosen to do something other than X, you would have succeeded**.

notes: even if I chose to raise my arm up and down at some point, I still cannot escape from this, that means I cannot have such a possibility to "succeed" from Ayer's view. 

**"conditional analysis"**:

a. she has the power to act otherwise is equivalent to 

b. if she had chosen to do something other than what she did in fact do, then she would have succeeded.

BUT,is it the final definition of libertarianism?

No, take evil robot as example again, this time, an evil scientist takes away a part in my brain to control my mind by affecting my decision mechanism, then it "looks" like now I'm still acting freely. But IN FACT, I ain't.

As an incompatiblist, Chisholm thought:

**Chisholm**: What if you can't do otherwise because you ***can't choose*** to do otherwise?

##Arguments from **INDETERMINISM**

1. ***Not*** everything that happens is determined by *prior* events (Indeterminism)
2. One acts freely only if one has the power to determine which actions one performs (control condition)

		there is no causal connection between my actions and my will, it looks like my actions happend to me, they are coming out of blue. I have no control over what I do.

3. If one's actions are not determined by prior events, then one lacks the power to determine which actions one performs.

**conclusion**: No one ever acts freely (1, 2, 3)

**The way out?** (by Chisholm)

"Transeunt" causation = event causation

"Immanent" causation = agent causation (p.483)

	If someone burns the school down, it is the person would be on trial, not the "event".

>A staff moves a stone, and is moved by a hand, which is moved by a man.
					--- Aristotle
					
one event: stone moves, caused by another event, a staff moves, caused by another event, hand moves, caused by an agent, namely, a man.
					
##Personal Identity

The question of **personhood**: what is a person?

The question of **personal identity** over time: under what circumstances is a person? At a later time the same person as a person at an earlier time? (two different questions above)

**Numerical identity**: X and Y are numerically identical if and only if they are one and the same thing. (e.g. Bruce Wayne and Batman)
	
vs.

**Qualitative identity**: X and Y are qualitatively identical if and only if they have exactly the same properties. (e.g. identical watches, Big Macs)

	Necessary conditions: P is a necessary condition for Q if and only if (iff) you can't have Q without P.

	Q -> P

	Sufficient conditions: P is a sufficient condition for Q iff you can't have P without Q
	
	P -> Q

	e.g Oxygen in a house is a necessary condition of a fire but not a sufficient condition of it.

	??? <-> personal identity

**Body Theory**: Persons are living, human bodies X is the same person as Y iff X and Y have the same living, human body.

~ **Brain Theory**: a more *specific* version of **Body Theory**. What a person is is a functioning brain.

**Soul Theory**: Persons are souls. X is the same person as Y iff X and Y have the same soul.

**Psychological Theory (John Locke)**: Persons are ongoing streams of psychological connectedness. X is the same person as Y iff X and Y are "Psychologically connected" in the right kind of way.
