ASHLEE FERREIRA: MONDAYS 2-3 PM JHB 522 OR BY APPOINTMENT.

>Sometimes it's hard to come up with a direct prove of "p", instead, you can assume ~("p"), then if you can get something like both "q" and "not q", namely a CONTRADICTION, then you proved "p" now. The method is called REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM (反证法).

**Omnipotence(全能)**: being able to DO anything it's possible to DO.

**Omniscience(全知)**: being able to KNOW anything it's possible to KNOW.

**Omnibenevolence(全爱)**: being COMPLETELY GOOD.

###THEISM: GOD EXISTS. 有神论

**RATIONAL THEISM**: there is a rational basis for belief in god.

*Both Anselm and Paley are rational theists.*

>You can still be a rational theists, if you don't think Anselm's and Paley's arguments are not good enough.

**ARATIONAL THEISM**: there's no rational basis for belief in god, but one should believe in god anyway.

>You can be a rational theists, even if you don't have even any arguments that claim God exists. (NO rational basis for or against God.)

**IRRATIONAL THEISM**: there's a rational basis for believing that god DOESN'T exist, but one should believe in god anyway.

###ATHEISM: GOD DOESN'T EXIST. 无神论

###AGNOSTICISM: WE CAN'T KNOW WHETHER GOD EXISTS OR NOT. 不可知论

###ANSELM:

*Anselm didn't bring any evidence to prove his argument, he was doing something like, "existence is one part you should agree", "ontological".*

>His argument is always called *[a priori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_knowledge)* (先验).

>>Anselm thinks he can prove something with easily unpacking the definition of this "something". And he thinks he is giving a sound argument here.

>>>But most people see this "lousy".

	[Definition] "God" = "something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought", this is to say, God is something which has no room for improvement.
	[Premise1] The fool understands what it means to speak of something than which nothing greater can be thought. (the fools: ATHEISM)
	[Premise2] If someone understands what it means to speak of x, then x exists in their understanding.
	[Conclusion1] God exists in the fool's understanding.
	
	that's round 1.
	
	*[Assumption] God exists ONLY in the fool's understanding.
	[Premise3] We (including the fools) can conceive of God existing in reality.
	[Conclusion2] God exists only in the fool's understanding, yet we can conceive of God also exsiting in reality. [A, P3]
	[Premise4] If x exists only in someone's understanding, yet we can conceive of it also existing in reality, then x can be conceived to be greater than it is. (There is room for improvement!)
	[Conclusion3] God can be conceived to be greater than God is.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	[Conclusion4]? Something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought can be conceived to be greater than something-than-whichn-nothing-greater-can-be-though.
	[Conclusion5]? The denial of Assumption! Prove Assumption wrong.

###ROWE:

Rowe is an atheist.

>"possible things" means everything DOESN'T INVOLVE CONTRADICTION, including nonexisting things and exisitng things.

>>What is impossible? A round square.
	
>>>Although Anselm doesn't say this in his argument, Rowe believes adding "God is a possible things" to Anselm's argument("God is a perfect existing thing") would be a sort of support, then prove God exists.

i.e. **existence = it's a possible thing + it's an existing thing**

	magician:
		- magican = existing magician
		- magico = nonexsiting magician
	
	[Premise1] Anselm defines God as a perfect existing thing.
	[Premise2]

###PALEY:

**Paley's method is called "[a posteriori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori)"**(后验)

Local vs. global

	[Premise1] Fact: There are natural objects (e.g. eyes) that, like obvious creations of intelligence (e.g. watches), appear to have been designed for a purpose.
	[Premise2] This fact requires explanation.
	[Premise3] The only reasonable explanation of this fact (i.e. [Premise1]) is that natural objects are the creations of an extremely powerful intelligent designer.
	[Premise4] "ITBE = Inference To the Best Explanation": If a fact F requires explanation, and if hypotheis H is the only reasonalbe explanation of F, then it's reasonable to believe H.
