##Ability Knowledge
e.g. I know how to ride a bike
##Factual Knowledge
e.g. I know that the giants won the world series last year.
##Acquaintance Knowledge
e.g. I know Rob Ford.
##"JTB = Justified True Belief" Theory of Knowledge
P stands for a statement / proposition. S stands for "somebody".

S knows that P iff:

1. P is **T**rue (Knowledge is "factive")
2. S **B**elieves that P (Psychological attitude)
3. S is **J**ustified in believing that P (Knowledge requires "having good reasons" for one's belief)

A true Belief is not enought to be a knowledge, needs good reasons to believe. One needs to know why the belif is true.

1-3 <=> knowledge

#Edmund Gettier
###Gettier problem
2 assumptions:

I) In whatever sense of "justified" relevant to **3**.(up in JTB section), it's possible for someone to be justifeid in believing something false.

II) For any proposition P, if S is justified in believing P and P entails Q and S deduces Q from P and accepts Q as a result of this deduction, then S is justified in believing Q. (page 345)

D) "Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has 10 coins in his pocket."

E) "The man who will get the job has 10 coins in his pocket."

F) "Jones owns a Ford."

G) "Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Boston."

H) "Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona."

I) "Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Berlin."

Conclusion from Gettier's argument: **JTB does not state a *sufficient* condition for someone's knowing a given proposition.**

##Skepticism
The view that we lack knowledge, that we don't know things we may **think** we know.

… About the past; about other minds.

… About the "external world".

NB: **NOT** the view that there is no external world. Maybe that's true, maybe it isn't. Add this to the things we don't know!

##Psychological Certainty
One is psychologically certain of proposition P iff one has no doubts regarding P.

**vs.**

##Evidential Certainty
One is evidentially certain of proposition P iff one's evidence for P "guarantees" P, that is, iff one's evidence is logically incompatible without not-P.

---
**P1**: Our evidence for the external world propositions we believe doesn't guarantee that any of them is true.

**C1**: We're not evidentially certain of any propositions about the external world [P1, Definition of evidential certainty]

**P2**: Knowledge requires evidential certainty: one knows P only if one is evidentially certain of P.

**C2**: We don't know any propositions about the external world. [C1, P2]

##Skeptical Hypothesis
A hypothesis that:

i) Renders false most (or all) of our beliefs about the external world, and yet

ii) We can't rule it out.

###Moore
1) If one doesn't know that one isn't dreaming, then one doesn't know that one is standing and awake.

2) You don't know that you aren't dreaming.

----
Conclusion: You don't know you're standing and awake.
