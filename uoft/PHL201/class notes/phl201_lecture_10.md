Today:

- Aristotle
- Kant
- J.S.Mill

##Aristotle (384-322BC)
Aristotle believes Ethics is a science.

Aristotle's categorized science into:

**Science / Goal**

1. Theoretical: Physics / Understanding

2. Productive: Medicine (any applied science) / Product

3. Practical:  Ethics / Action

usually we ask, What are you doing and why? (Ethics is aim at actions)

Bridle making: you made a bridle not for your own sake, it must have other purposes. For ride a horse, a horse carries warrior, warriors win the battle…

Bridle making -> riding -> strategy -> victory -> power ->… 

"**HAPPINESS**" - Flourishing

**not** equivalent to "**being pleased with how one's life is going**"

This is a good explanation for everything you do.

"Endoxil method" ?

###Chase of lives

candidates of happiness:

**Activity / Goal**

1. Gratification / pleasure
2. Politics / honour? (no! honour is just the recognition) excellence (must be active excellence)
3. Contemplation / Study
4. Money? （no!）

###Function Argument

- craft
- parts of the body (cannot judge some properties of parts also belong to the whole)

x Fallacy of composition?

e.g. If someone stands up out of their seat at a baseball game, they can see better. Therefore, if everyone stands up they can all see better.

If a runner runs faster, she can win the race. Therefore if all the runners run faster, they can all win the race.

###Book II
Moral vs. Intellectual excellence

"Moral virtue lies in a mean"

i.e. **excellence** is between **deficiency** and **excess**

e.g **courage** is between **cowardice** and **rashness**

##Kant (1724-1804)
Deontological (Duty-based) Theory

Theory of Ethics

Three mental causes of voluntary human action:

1) acting because one regards the action as a means to desired ends

e.g. DESIRE + BELIEF => ACTION

2) acting from immediate inclination

e.g. love or benevolence
FEELING + BELIEF => ACTION

3) acting from the sense of duty

e.g. "The person of good will"

- When 1-3 motivate us to act, they determine our "maxim" for action, i.e. a general rule governing what one does.
- One's acting in some way only has "moral worth" i.e. "intrinsic value" if one does it from duty.

##Less Plausible reading:
X's doing A has moral worth iff X ought do A, and X does A only "from duty" (i.e. is motivated to do A by and only by the thought that she ought do A.)

##More Plausible reading:
X's doing A has moral worth iff X ought to do A, and X is motivated to do A by the thought that he ought to do A and whatever other motives she may also have, X would do A even if she had not had them.

##Categorial Imperative:
1. "Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law."
2. "Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as n end."
3. "Act always so as to aid in bringing about the kingdom of ends."
