----

	1) Fact: there are natural objects (e.g. eyes) that, like obvious creations of intelligence (e.g. watches), appear to have been designed for a purpose.

	2) This fact requires explanation.

	3) The only reasonable explanation is that natural objects are the creations of an extremely powerful intelligent designer.

	4) ITBE (Inference To the Best Explanation): If a fact F requires explanation, and if hypothesis H is the only reasonable explanation for F, then it's reasonable to believe H.

	C1) It's reasonable to believe that an extremely powerful intelligent designer exists.

	C2) It's reasonable to believe that GOD EXISTS.

##Problem of Evil

(our last problem in philosophy of region)

a) God is omnipotent.

b) God is wholly good.

c) Evil exists.

*all these three cannot be true at the same time.*

***1.Good is opposed to evil: a good thing always eliminates evil as far as it can.***

***2.There are no limits to what an omnipotent thing can do.***

1) assume that god - a la a, b, c - exists.

2) if something is good, then it always eliminates evil as far as it can (*).

3) God is wholly good (b).

4) so God always eliminates evils as far as god can (2, 3).

5) if something is omnipotent, then there are no limits to what it can do (**).

6) god is omnipotent (a).

7) so there are no limits to what god can do (5, 6).

8) so god eliminates evil completely.

9) there is evil.

10) so GOD DOES NOT EXIST.

##Hick on moral evil
A) something is a person only if it's genuinely free.

B) something is genuinely free only if it can choose to do wrong.

C) so something is a person only if it can choose to do wrong.

D) a world with persons > world without

##Hick on non-moral evil

F) persons can "make souls" only if the world contains non-moral evil.

G) a world in which persons can "make souls" > one in which they can't

H) so a world containing non-moral evil > one that doesn't

##CAUSAL DETERMINISM (CD)
A statement of all the facts at time *t* (inc. facts about people's heredity, environment etc.), together with a statement of the law's of nature, logically entails what will happen at any future time *t + 1*.

###Argument from determinism

1) Everything that happens is determined by prior events (CD).

2) One acts freely only if one has the power to act otherwise (choice condition).

3) If one's actions are determined, then one lacks the power to act otherwise.

---
NO ONE ACTS FREELY (1, 2, 3).

	If CD is true, then we're not free.
	CD is true.
	---------------
	so we're not free. (modus ponens)


	If CD is true, then we're not free.
	We are free.
	-----------------
	so CD is false. 

the difference between freedom or unfreedom is being caused in a right way or a wrong way.
