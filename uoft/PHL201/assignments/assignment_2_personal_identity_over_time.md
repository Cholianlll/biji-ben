#PHL 201 Assignment 2: Personal Identity Over Time

Turnitin: hemlock

ClassID: 6507970

What does personal identity consist in? Does it consist in psychological continuity? **Does it consist in bodily continuity?** Does it consist in the continuity of a soul? Or does it consist in something else?

This paper involves three jobs:

**Job #1 – Explain what the question of personal identity over time means.** Explain in your own words what it is we’re interested in when we ask about personal identity over time. What is it and why does it matter?

**Job #2 – Present and defend an argument for one of the abovementioned options.** Make the best case you can for your preferred theory. You may use any relevant argument you find in your assigned readings, provided you express it in your own words and give it the most complete and thorough defense you can. You may also devise an argument of your own. Whatever you do, though, make sure to define any technical terms you use. If you’re in doubt about whether a term qualifies as ‘technical,’ then ask yourself the following question: ‘Could I reasonably expect a friend of mine not enrolled in this course to understand the term as I’m using it?’ If the answer is no, then it’s a technical term and you need to explain it. What if you reject all of the abovementioned options, on the ground that the question of personal identity is somehow incoherent? In this case, defend an argument for what you think the truth about personal identity over time is. But make sure to give a full explanation and to define any technical terms you use.

**Job #3 – Defend your chosen theory from what you take to be the most devastating objection to it.** How would an intelligent person who rejects your favored theory criticize it and the case you make for it? Your job here is to reply to this criticism by showing that, serious though the objection may be, it can be deflected. This is your opportunity to make an original contribution of the debate, so don’t simply rehearse one of the objections we covered in class. The very best papers won’t simply raise an objection and respond to it, they will go on to consider follow-up objections and responses to those and so on. For example, if you adopt a Lockean position for Job #2, then don’t simply rehearse Reid’s objection to Locke. You should consider a possible response from Locke to Reid’s objection, and then a possible reply from Reid, and so on.

##Personal Identity

The question of **personhood**: what is a person?

The question of **personal identity** over time: under what circumstances is a person? At a later time the same person as a person at an earlier time? (two different questions above)

**Numerical identity**: X and Y are numerically identical if and only if they are one and the same thing. (e.g. Bruce Wayne and Batman)
	
vs.

**Qualitative identity**: X and Y are qualitatively identical if and only if they have exactly the same properties. (e.g. identical watches, Big Macs)

	Necessary conditions: P is a necessary condition for Q if and only if (iff) you can't have Q without P.

	Q -> P

	Sufficient conditions: P is a sufficient condition for Q iff you can't have P without Q
	
	P -> Q

	e.g Oxygen in a house is a necessary condition of a fire but not a sufficient condition of it.

	??? <-> personal identity

**Body Theory**: Persons are living, human bodies X is the same person as Y iff X and Y have the same living, human body.

~ **Brain Theory**: a more *specific* version of **Body Theory**. What a person is is a functioning brain.

**Soul Theory**: Persons are souls. X is the same person as Y iff X and Y have the same soul.

**Psychological Theory (John Locke)**: Persons are ongoing streams of psychological connectedness. X is the same person as Y iff X and Y are "Psychologically connected" in the right kind of way.

###Body Theory/ Brain Theory

###Psychological Theory

Persons are ongoing **STREAMS** of **psychological connectedness**. X is the same person as Y iff X and Y are psychologically connected in the right kind of way.

###Memory Theory (Locke)

Persons are ongoing streams of **memory connections**. X is the same person as Y iff X remembers at least some of what Y did, thought, and felt.

*What Locke is talking about* is "**episodic**" memory

"EPISODIC" memory (doing, thinking and feeling)

vs.

"FACTUAL" memory (FACT; information)

vs.

"ACQUAINTANCE" memory (like how to ride a bike, what my cousin looks like, etc.)

##Reid

He proposed a famous objection to Locke's theory of personal identity.

![table2](/Users/Rexarski/Desktop/table2.png)

- Transitivity?
- Name schoolboy A, officer B and general C. then we assume general remembers when he was an officer, and the officer remembers when he was a schoolboy, but the general doesn't remember when he was a schoolboy.
- now we have: B = C, A = B, but A != C (according to Locke)
- But we know that they are the same person, i.e. A = B = C.

###Memory connection

X and Y are **memory connected** iff X remembers at least some of what Y did, thought, felt.

###Memory Continuity

X and Y are **memory continuous** iff Y is the last link in a chain of persons beginning with X which is such that each person in the chain is memory connected with the preceding person.

##Consequences of Locke/Reid's theory of PERSONAL IDENTITY:

SLEEP?

AMNESIA?

DRUNKENNESS?

##Derek Parfit

Suppose we have a perfect teleporter that can make a blueprint for you while you are on it, which includes all of your psychological components, then the other end of the teleporter on Mars duplicate successfully and completely another "you". Does this mean "you" travelled to Mars? Or is that "you" or other person?

(Assume A is on earth, and B, C on Mars.)

A = B, A != C

A = C, A != B

A = B & A =C

A != B, A != C
