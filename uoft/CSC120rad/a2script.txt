# (deaths and tmax).

# Function to make plots of predictions as needed for this assignment.
# The arguments are the predictions, the (full) series of actual
# values, and a string describing how the predictions were made (used
# in the title).  The start and end of the portion of "series" to
# predict are taken from global variables.  The average absolute error
# is included in the title for the set of plots.
