\section*{Part 2: Additional Integrity Constraints [16\% - 4 marks each]}

Below are some additional integrity constraints on our schema. Express each of them 
using the notation from Section 2.5 of your textbook. If a constraint cannot be 
expressed using such notations, simply write ``cannot be expressed''.


\begin{enumerate}

\item   % ----------
An athlete cannot win more than one medal type in the same event.

{\bf Answer}:\\[5pt]
{
$
\sigma_{R1.AID=R2.AID \wedge R1.medal \not=R2.medal}(\rho_{R1}(Result) \times \rho_{R2}(Result)) = \emptyset
$
}

\item   % ---------- 
All tickets for an event have to be purchased before the time of the event.

{\bf Answer}:\\[5pt]
{
$
LateDate := \sigma_{Event.date > Ticket.dateIssued}(Event \bowtie Ticket)\\[5pt]
SameDateLateTime := \sigma_{(Event.date = Ticket.dateIssued) \wedge (Event.time > Ticket.timeIssued)}(Event \bowtie Ticket)\\[5pt]
LateDate \cup SameDateLateTime = \emptyset
$
}


\item   % ---------- 
The number of tickets purchased for an event should not exceed the capacity 
of the stadium where the event takes place.

{\bf Answer}:\\[5pt]
{
$
\text{Cannot be expressed.}
$
}

\item   % ---------- 
An athlete could not have competed in an event for a sporting discipline 
that they are not qualified to participate in.

{\bf Answer}:\\[5pt]
{
$
Qualified(sport) := \Pi_{sport}(Event \bowtie Athelete) \\[5pt]
Unqualified(sport) := \Pi_{sport} - Qualified \\[5pt]
Unqualified - Qualified = \emptyset
$
}

\end{enumerate}
