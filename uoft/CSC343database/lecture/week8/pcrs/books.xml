         <CONTENT>A highly recommended read for those who know or want to know more about the worst nuclear accident in history, especially from those closely involved either. The insightful accounts give this book a great deal of credibility and expose the reader to the Soviet Union , Ukraine, Russia and Belarus in an intimate way. Like the voices in the books The Union Moujik, The Master and the Margarita, the people in this book come alive with alacrity.</CONTENT>
