Two adjustment

Posted on: Monday, January 27, 2014

Dear All,

I need to tell you two adjustment for what I said on Office hours.

1. absolute convergence ==> convergence. 
By using the definition of Cauchy sequence, claim that the original sequence is Cauchy (thus converge). You may need triangular inequality.

2. ON page 43, Problem P(u), one cannot add every 6 term together, to prove it is converge.
In fact, one cannot change the order or add some terms together like one term to prove convergence of series. Famous examples are \sum_1^{\infty}(-1)^n and \sum_1^{\infty}n*[(-1)^n], both of which are diverge(since limit of these terms are not 0).

However, one can use the definition of Cauchy sequence to prove it is convergent(maybe with the fact that \sum_1^{\infity}\frac{1}{n^2} converges). One can also prove that it is not absolutely convergent by comparing to \sum_1^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}.

Best,
