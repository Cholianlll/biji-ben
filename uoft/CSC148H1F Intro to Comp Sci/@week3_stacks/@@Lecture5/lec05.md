- for ADT(abstract data type), we don't care about how they work, but only care about what they can do.
- the ADT we've learned: lists, dictionaries, files, tuples.
- the only **4 methods stack can do**:
	- __init__
	- is_empty
	- push
	- pop

- restrictive: comparing with lists, stacks are more restrictive(only insert or delete the very top). then why do we need stacks instead of lists?
- the idea is to make the codes simpler.
