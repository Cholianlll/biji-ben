##Week 4 - Linked Lists
September 29, 2014

today we're gonna play around with a familiar ADT: list.

get item at index

insert item at index

remove item at index


###arrays
- get = constant time
- insert, delete = linear time

###linked lists
- each items stores where the 'next' item is
- not consecutive as a common list, but like a 'chain'

- let's create a node class like 'PeopleChain'
- and a LinkedList class only with one attribute, items

- benefit of linked list, is that, time-saving while running. no need to shift things over.
