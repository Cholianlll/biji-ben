#Week 1 - Welcome!

September 8, 2014

If you're reading this page, here's what to get excited about for this course:

- **Object-oriented design**: use classes to design clear, easy to understand programs modelling real-world problems.
- **Thinking recursively**: take advantage of certain problem structures to write elegant, simple code.
- **Data structures**: organise and manipulate data using stacks, linked lists, trees, and more.
- **Program Efficiency**: analyse how long it takes your programs to run, and how much memory they take.


Along the way, you'll develop **good habits** that will serve you well for the rest of your career, academic and beyond:

- Think before typing. Design programs on paper first!
- Testing beyond printing. Use testing and debugging tools to guide and validate your programs.
- Learning without teachers. Work independently or with your peers to find and learn new information to solve your tasks.

##Pre-term preparation

CSC148 uses the Python programming language. You're expected to have all the basic programming skills covered from CSC108, or an equivalent introductory programming class. If you're unsure, check with us before you get in too deep!

There will be a CSC148 ramp-up session that covers the basics of Python for CSC108. Those of you who haven't taken the course should really, really try to attend!

The programming environment for this course consists of two components: the language is Python 3 (not Python 2), and Wing IDE 101. The CDF labs already have these installed, but they're pretty straightforward to set up on your own machines too.

##Your Typical Week

This term we're trying something a little different: the workload will be about the same as previous years (~9 hours/week), but we're going to put more a focus on weekly tasks to help you keep up with the material. Here's what a typical week will look like for you:

- **Lecture** (Mon/Wed). I'll do my best to present new material and have interactive exercises to get you thinking!
- **Lab** (Thurs). In a computer lab, you'll explore the week's concepts in greater detail, and ask your TA lots of questions. You'll also get hands-on practice with Python tools like unit testing and time profilers.
- **Exercise** (all week). Each week, you'll be assigned a few short programming tasks that are designed to make sure you're keeping up with the material. You'll usually also receive at least one task that will require you to do some learning on your own - previews for the next week. All of these tasks will be automatically marked, so the results will be available to you immediately. Each exercise takes about 2-3 hours per week.
- 
Altogether, this accounts for roughly 6-7 hours per week. Throughout the term, you'll have two **assignments** to work on, with up to two other students. These are larger programming challenges that will synthesize multiple weeks' worth of material, and involve both design and testing in addition to writing code. **They will be very manageable if you start early, and extremely stressful if you don't.**

Check out the FAQ for more information on the exercises and assignments.

There will also be two **midterms** and one **final**: these will be a mix of conceptual and programming questions, drawn from in-class material and the exercises. I'll post more information about these as they approach.
