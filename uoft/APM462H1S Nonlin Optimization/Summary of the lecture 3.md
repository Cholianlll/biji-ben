Summary of the lecture of Monday January 20:

We covered the following material (not in this order)

I) section 7.7 of the text, omitting the proposition on p. 204-5 and its 
corollaries, but going over the statement and proof of the Global Convergence Theorem 
in detail.  In our discussion thetheorem, we only talked about the problem of 
minimizing a function f, without referring to a "descent function" Z. So f played 
the role of Z (from the textbook) in the proof I presented, and Gamma was exactly the set 
of minimizers of f.

It is not important to know the details of the proof. But it is important to be able 
to apply the theorem. In particular, you should grasp the definition of a 
closed point-to-set mapping well enough to be able to check whether it applies to 
concrete examples. 

We also discussed aspects of Examples 2 and 6.

II) section 8.2 of the text: Newton's method (with proof of convergence), and the 
"method of false position" and "quadratic fit" without a proof of convergence.

III) We introduced the notion of a "line search" algorithm from section 8.4. We did not prove 
closedness of line search algorithms but will discuss some related topics next week.
IV) We also discussed several examples of line search algorithms, including the method of 
Steepest Descent from Section 8.6 - we just considered the definition briefly at the end 
of the lecture, and we will discuss it in more detail next week. We also  discussed (essentially) 

the Coordinate Descent method from section 8.9 in 2 dimensions, considering some examples and 
arguing that the method can fail to converge if for example f(x,y) = \max( |x|, |y|).
